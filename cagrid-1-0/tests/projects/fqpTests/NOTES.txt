Tests needed:

1) Query w/ caGrid Transfer retrieval
2) Query w/ Delegated Credential
	-- stand up a CDS, delegate a credential, use it
	** Negative testing:
		-- delegate a credential to NON-fqp, try to use it, expect failure
		-- delegate a credential, authenticate as anonymous, try to use it, expect failure
3) Query w/ Partial Results
	-- Query against > 1 target data service; have one fail
	-- Verify notification behaves as expected
	-- Verify results from working target data service are returned
	.. Test exists, currently fails since ProcessingStatus isn't set correctly
