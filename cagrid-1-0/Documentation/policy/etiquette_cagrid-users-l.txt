Welcome to the caGrid Users Mailing List, hosted by the NIH.

What is caGrid?
---------------
caGrid was built by, and is the technical foundation of, The National 
Cancer Institute's (NCI) Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG(TM)). 

caGrid has also been adopted as the basis for other scientific
grids, including the Cardiovascular Research Grid (CVRG) and
by the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) in the UK.

Participation
-------------
Hundreds of people subscribe to the list, including:
	* Staff from the NCI,
	* Participants in the caBIG(TM) program,
	* Non-caBIG(TM) users of caGrid, such as CVRG or NCRI, and
	* Grid computing enthusiasts who find value our tools 

The list is open; anyone can ask or reply to questions. We encourage
participation with a few caveats. 

Before you post
---------------
To minimize duplicate posts, we ask that you first check the caGrid
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and search the archives. The URL
for these and other informative resources can be found below.

Proper Etiquette: New Posting
-----------------------------
When posting, please be as specific as possible, and include (if applicable):
	* the caGrid component and version to which the posting refers
	* a description of your problem, including background information 
	  about your use case that may speed resolution
	* what steps you have taken to try and resolve the problem
	* configuration information
	* stack trace

If your question is not troubleshooting, but information-gathering in nature,
(can I use Dorian to...?), the same rules apply: please be as specific as 
possible about your use case, and explain your issue or how you expect to 
leverage a component.

Proper Etiquette: Answering a Posting
-------------------------------------
Community members are encouraged to participate: if you know the answer,
feel free to speak up. 

What is inappropriate?
----------------------
Please do not:
	* Ask open-ended questions but expect closed-ended answers
	* Cross-post to other lists
	* Post your thoughts ("I wonder if", "I'll try this next")
	* Profanity
	* Uncivil communication to other participants
	* Off-topic Discussion - anything from weather to issues with 
	  other caBIG(TM) applications

We ask our participants to follow these guidelines so all our community 
members find the posts relevant and informative.
