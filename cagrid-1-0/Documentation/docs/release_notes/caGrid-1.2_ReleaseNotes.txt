                      1.0 caGrid Introduction
================================================================

    This document contains the release notes for the caGrid 1.2
    release.  

    caGrid 1.2 is a point release of the caGrid 1.x stream.  It
    is backwards compatible with the service interfaces of caGrid 1.0/1.1.
    That is, services and applications developed against the caGrid 1.0 or 1.1
    release, will continue to function against caGrid 1.2 versions of
    those services (including the production grid).

    This release of caGrid supports caBIG compatibility level gold.
