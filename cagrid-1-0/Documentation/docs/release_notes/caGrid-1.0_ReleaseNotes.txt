                      1.0 caGrid Introduction
================================================================

    This document contains the release notes for the caGrid 1.0
    release.  

    caGrid 1.0 is a revolutionary release of the caGrid infrastructure.
    It is generally not compatible with caGrid 0.5.x releases, though
    conceptually, it plays the same role with increased stability,
    enhanced functionality, and scope. 

    This release of caGrid supports caBIG compatibility level gold.

                      3.0 New Features and Updates
================================================================

Building the software:
	A graphical installer is provided which will install
	prerequisites and a source release of caGrid.
	Both the source release of caGrid, and the installer installed
	distribution must be built before any tools can be used.
	
	To build caGrid, type:
	ant clean all

	To find out other targets available, and type:
	ant -p

	To find out targets available in each project, cd to the project's
	directory (projects/*), and type:
	ant -p
	
	More information can be found on the Wiki:
	http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/plugins/wiki/index.php?id=25&type=g

Introduce:
	Introduce is the caGrid service creation toolkit.  It provides
	the capability to create both Analytical and Data services.
		
Dorian:
	Dorian is the caGrid identity federation solution.  It provides
	the capability to integrate with institutional identity management
	systems, as well as create a local user management solution.  It
	consists of both a service and client APIs and tools.
	
	The Dorian service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

Authentication Service:
	The Authentication Service provides a framework for issuing SAML assertions
	for existing user identity providers such that they may be used to obtain
	grid credentials from Dorian.  It provides a uniform authentication
	interface on which applications can be built.
	
	The Autentication Service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

GTS:
	GTS is the caGrid trust management service.  The Grid Trust Service (GTS)
	is a WSRF compliant grid service framework for the creation, management,
	and provisioning of a federated grid trust fabric.  It consists of both
	a service and client APIs and tools.
	
	The GTS service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.
	
SyncGTS:
	SyncGTS is a mechanism used synchronize a Globus installation with
	the trust fabric maintained in a GTS deployment.  It consists of
	both a service (to dynamically synchronize a service container
	with the trust fabric) and client APIs and command line tools. 
	
	The SyncGTS service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

Grid Grouper:
	Grid Grouper provides a group based authorization solution for the grid, 
	where grid services and applications enforce authorization policy based on
	membership to groups defined and managed at the grid level.  Grid Grouper is
	built on top of Grouper, an internet initiative focused on providing tools
	for group management.
	
	The Grid Grouper service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

Authorization Module:
	The main responsibility of the Authorization (Authz) component is to provide
	an integration point between local authorization policy and grid-wide
	authorization policy. It provides a framework to integrate groups that have
	been defined in the Common Security Module (CSM) and Grid Grouper groups,
	enabling local administrators to extend access privileges to members of the
	caBIG community based on membership in Grid Grouper groups, rather than
	having to create local identities for each individual

Discovery API:
	The Discovery client API provides a high-level API to discover advertised
	services in the grid.  A command line client (which makes use of the API)
	is provided solely for demonstration purposes.

caDSR Service:
	The caDSR grid service provides grid service access to UML-like information in items
	registered in caDSR.  Additionally, it provides the ability to generate caGrid metadata
	instances for grid services.  Finally, it is integrated into Introduce to provide UML
	model browsing and type discovery.  It consists of both a service and client APIs and tools.
	
	The caDSR service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

EVS Service:
	The EVS grid service provides access to data semantics and controlled
	terminology as managed by the NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Service
	
	The EVS service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

GME:
	The Global Model Exchange (GME) grid service provides grid service access to the
	XML Schemas used by the caGrid infrastructure.  It is integrated into Introduce
	to provide XML Schema model browsing, upload, and type discovery.  It consists of
	both a service and client APIs and tools.

Index Service:
	The Globus Index Service is used as the grid service registry, white pages, and yellow pages.
	When caGrid services start up, they register their existence and metadata to the Index Service, 
	and the Discovery API allows clients to discovery services in the registry.  caGrid uses an
	unaltered version of the Globus Index Service, and provides convenience mechanisms to deploy it.
	The Globus clients can be used to query the Index Service directly.

caGrid Portal:
	The Monitoring and Discovery Portal is a web application providing an
	overview of the status all running grid services (Data, Analytical and Core)
	based on aggregated information (from the Index Service).

Federated Query Service:
	The caGrid Federated Query Infrastructure provides a mechanism to perform
	basic distributed aggregations and joins of queries over multiple data services.
	
	The Federated Query Service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.	

Workflow:
	The Workflow component is used to submit and run simple workflows that are
	written using BPEL. More details on how to deploy, submit workflows can be found
	in projects/workflow/README.
	
	The Workflow service was created with Introduce, and can also be edited/deployed
	via Introduce.

Identifiers:
	The Indentifiers framework represents the initial effort for integration of
	the Handle system, aimed at providing grid-wide unique identifiers.

                     5.0 Known Issues Not Yet Fixed
================================================================

Update to date bug reports and feature requests can be found on the tracker section
of the project's gforge site:
http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/?group_id=25

--------------------
Global Model Exchange Related
--------------------
----------
ISSUE:
	GME Deployment does not allow for running GME on any other port besides 8080
DETAILS:
	When the GME gets deployed the port which is written into the gme config file
	is always set to 8080.  This means that the GME, when it wants to talk with itself, will attempt
	to do so on the wrong port if the GME is actually running in a container which is on anything
	other than 8080.
IMPACT:
	 Will cause an exception to be thrown back when tryin access the GME when it is on another port.
WORKAROUND:
	After the GME is deployed go to the etc dir of the container for the GME and edit the config
	file to have the correct URL for the GME grid service once the container is restarted.
----------


--------------------
caCORE Related
--------------------
----------
ISSUE:
	[#1277] caCORE schemas contain cyclic references
DETAILS:
	http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1277&group_id=38&atid=279
IMPACT:
	GME will not accept XSDs with cycles, therefore XSDs with cycles cannot be uploaded.
WORKAROUND:
	None, without editing the XSD/Model.
----------
----------
ISSUE:
	[#1293] LazyInitializationException thrown, but correct data returned
DETAILS:
	http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1293&group_id=38&atid=279
IMPACT:
	Minimal; makes it difficult to identify "real" exceptions in caDSR service.
WORKAROUND:
	None (without editing caCORE source code).
----------


--------------------
Worflow Related
----------
ISSUE:
	Workflow service does not properly communicate with secure services.
WORKAROUND:
	The code attempts to use the user's proxy; a code fix will be required post-release.
----------
--------------------
----------
ISSUE:
	Services using Secure Messaging/Conversation cannot be accessed by the Workflow service
WORKAROUND:
	None, support will be provided as a fix in the incremental release.
----------
----------
ISSUE:
	Services using WSRF Resource pattern cannot be accessed by the Workflow service
DETAILS:
	Current version of ActiveBPEL, 2.1, does not support this yet.
WORKAROUND:
	None, until ActiveBPEL supports (development under way)
