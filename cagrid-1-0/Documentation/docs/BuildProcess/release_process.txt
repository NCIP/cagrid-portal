We will only tag the caGrid directory, which is where the core code lives.
The trunk will be where active development occurs, and we will create a branch to maintain the release.
Users/Developers wanting to access the "release" will use a provided tag.

RELEASE PROCESS
====================
----- prepare the release branch -----
tag a branch root from the cagrid-1-0/caGrid dir of an up to date checkout of HEAD  (cvs tag caGrid-1_0_beta_root)
create a branch based on the branch root tag   (cvs tag -b -r caGrid-1_0_beta_root caGrid-1_0_beta)

----- prepare the release candidate -----
get a working checkout of the release branch in a new directory (cvs –d:ext:anonymous@cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov:/share/content/gforge/cagrid-1-0 co -r caGrid-1_0_beta -d caGrid-1.0beta cagrid-1-0/caGrid)
do fixing or clean needed on the branch
tag a release candidate on our checkout of the branch (cvs tag caGrid-1_0_beta_rc1)

-----  make a release candidate ----- 
create the release from a cvs export  (cvs –d:ext:anonymous@cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov:/share/content/gforge/cagrid-1-0 export -r caGrid-1_0_beta_rc1 -d {dir for checkout} cagrid-1-0/caGrid)
zip up or whatever is needed for the release the directory created {dir for checkout}

----- address any issues with the candidate -----
*** if bug fixes
  commit the fixes to our local branch checkout (cvs commit)
  tag a bug fix tag  (cvs tag caGrid-1_0_beta_rc1_bugfix1)
  merge bug fix into trunk
    from a HEAD checkout:
      get up to date  (cvs update)
      merge in the bug fix  (cvs update -j caGrid-1_0_beta_rc1 -j caGrid-1_0_beta_rc1_bugfix1)
      fix any merge issues
      commit the fix to HEAD (cvs commit)
  rense and repeat... tag a new release candidate  (cvs tag caGrid-1_0_beta_rc2)

-----  finalize the release -----
tag the release on the branch (cvs tag caGrid-1_0_beta_final)
create the release from a cvs export  (cvs –d:ext:anonymous@cbiocvs2.nci.nih.gov:/share/content/gforge/cagrid-1-0 export -r caGrid-1_0_beta_final -d {dir for checkout} cagrid-1-0/caGrid)
zip up or whatever is needed for the release the directory created {dir for checkout}
