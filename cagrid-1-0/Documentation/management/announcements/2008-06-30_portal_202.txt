On behalf of the caGrid Portal team, I am pleased to announce the
release of caGrid Portal version 2.0.2. Enhancements in this release
are focused primarily on using the caGrid semantic infrastructure to
perform service discoveries and data access from multiple services.

Some of the new functionality includes:
*	New query builder interface, with support for distributed caGrid
Query Language (DCQL) [RFE 14931]
*	Services can now be discovered using EVS concept codes [RFE 14932]
*	caBIG(TM) Tools, maintained by NCI CBIIT, are now displayed within
the portal [RFE 14930]
*	Services that no longer advertise to the index service are removed
from portal [RFE 13232]
