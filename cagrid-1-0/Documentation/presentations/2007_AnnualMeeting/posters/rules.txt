We are a month away from the caBIG™ 2007 Annual Meeting being held at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, D.C., February 5–7, 2007! At this time we would like to provide you with some details regarding your upcoming presentation. Please review the following information to learn about the poster session guidelines:

 

·         Each poster may only represent one abstract. 

·         Each poster should reflect the abstract and findings you presented in the online application submission system.

·         Posters must be displayed within a 4’ x 4’ space. Two posters will share one side of a board (an 8’ x 4’ space). If you will be presenting more than one poster we will ensure that your posters are next to each other or in close proximity to each other.

·         Posters may be a single piece or multiple pages as long as they fit within these dimensions.

·         Push pins, tape, or Velcro tabs will be available onsite when you arrive at the hotel.

·         All posters should clearly display: the poster title, author(s), and affiliation(s)/organization(s).

·         Poster set-up time is scheduled on Monday, February 5th from 10 am – 4 pm in Exhibit Hall C.

·         All posters must remain on display for the duration of the conference (until 4:45 pm on Wednesday, February 7th).

·         Poster tear-down will occur on Wednesday, February 7th from 4:45 – 6 pm, immediately after the last Meeting session. Posters not removed by 6 pm will be discarded to allow our group to vacate the hotel space efficiently and allow the hotel to prepare for their next group. 

·         One poster presentation space has been held for each accepted poster abstract. You will receive your poster board assignment upon check-in at the Annual Meeting. If for some reason you can no longer attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can make the adjustment.
