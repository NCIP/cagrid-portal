To expand on Avinash’s points below:

Let’s do plan on doing a dry run of the actual demos on the 29th.  Here should be the responsible parties for the demos:
Manav: 0.5 client demo 
Ravi, Patrick: Workflow demo 
Shannon, Steve: Dorian-Introduce demo 
Please let me know if you feel a meeting is necessary to discuss the logistics of the demos prior to the 29th.  We could meet briefly tomorrow during our regular call if necessary.

 

As for the walk through of the presentations/talks, let’s plan on spending the time on the 29th to review the current drafts.  Since we are currently focusing on the software, I don’t expect us to be ready to walk through the actual slides by the 29th.  Lets get a draft by the 29th, and then do a semi-final review the following Tuesday, the 4th.  We can then review the actual final slides on our meeting on the 6th.
Scott: Draft/Outline of caGrid 1.0 Architecture talk : End of the Week (3/24) 
All: Draft of component design slides (3/29) – You can begin now, and incorporate into the master presentation at the end of the week 
All: Semi-final slides, presented (4/4) 
All: Final slides, incorporating feedback (4/6)
