4) caBIO Portlet
5) Performance Issues

Notes
-----
1) Carolyn working on these, needs URL from Manav where Google map works. Will send guides for review when ready. Shooting to have everything reviewed and ready by COB next Friday (10-Oct).
2) Aynur was not on the call. Manav has not done walk through with her yet.
3) John discussed with Scott. Joshua and Manav can discuss on next developers call.
4) Sharon says they are generally on schedule with us. Can do a 4.1-based release of their portlet when we release 2.1, then deploy their new portlet when caBIO 4.2 comes out a few weeks later.
5) Production Portal is running slower. Manav is verifying the configuration on dev. Production needs to turn debugging off in the logs when we release 2.1. Still not certain why this is running slower.
