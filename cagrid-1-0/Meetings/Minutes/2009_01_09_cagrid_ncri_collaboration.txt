Agenda
------
1) Discussion of model comparison

Notes
-----
 - Joshua's document described possible approaches to exchanging data
   between portals.
 - The conclusion of the document was that it would not be feasible to
   support two-way exchange without significant changes to both
   applications. It also suggested that we need to consider other
   models, e.g. FOAF, DOAP, OWL-S.
 - ONIX team suggested that we start with caGrid -> ONIX exchange, and
   make assumptions necessary to produce ONIX-compatible data.
 - caGrid Portal team agreed that this would be a good approach.
   
Action Items
------------
 - caGrid Portal Team will provide ONIX team with DB dump and other
   relevant schema information.
 - ONIX team will provide further ideas on mapping caGrid Portal data
   into the ONIX model.
 - Next meeting we will discuss:
   - Future vision of caGrid Portal and Index Service.
   - How to handle provenance information.
