Notes
-----
1) Training Portal hosted at S.B. right now; Scott felt they should since it's their development. Avinash indicated that OSU's dev team should host training grid (including Portal) and Knowledge Center should run it.
3) caBIO Portlet uses Ajax, so it suffers from page update/refresh issue. Manav working on service diagnostic portlet. 
5) QA Portal was down yesterday, container up but in some indeterminent state. Can use the RSS feed (which is addressable) to test. 

Action Items
------------
1) John will talk to Scott and Justin 
2) John will talk to Craig Fee to see if this can be done.
3) John will let QA know that code freeze should be 9/15, they should be on our call 9/10 and 9/17. Continuous monthly QA will start after this release, and someone from QA should join our call on a bi-weekly basis after that. 
5) John will bring this up to Doug and systems team on Friday.
