Notes
-----
1) Larry has drafted use case model for FY2009 scope (contract). John's thoughts for scope of 2.2:
   1) Basic UI Cleanup (see attached)
      * Reposition Map
      * No scroll bars on homepage (if possible)
      * Cleanup "Contact Us", "Accessibility", and "Support"
      * Append "Portlet" to every portlet's name (Discovery becomes Discovery Portlet)
      * Change service list view in Discovery Portlet to include Hosting Center, maybe affect sort order from column names
      * Clean up the registration portlet, instructions are too long (nobody will read them)
   2) Performance
      * Google Map load speed (async? cache?)
      * Upgrade to latest Liferay (supports remote portlets, JSR286), especially before we integrate WebSSO
      * Minimize noise in logs (currently many "known exceptions")
      * JVM Parameters in delivered JBoss are not optimum (only use -server and -Xmx)
      * 64-bit JVM, if possible (tech stack deviation)
   3) Security
      * WebSSO integration 
   4) High Availability
      * Explore HA deployment of portal (may not be complete in 2.1, will require some code/documentation changes)
      ** mySQL Replication:  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication.html

2) Keep .NET Open
