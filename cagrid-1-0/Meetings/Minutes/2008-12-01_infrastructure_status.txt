Notes
-----
1) Satish was on vacation, back today. David found another bug that he reported last week. 
2) Received from Larry Hebel. Scott has started investigating and has shelled out the new service. Old service hacked against new caDSR seems to work. Still waiting for official external/official URL and timeline/dates.
3) Draft posted to wiki (http://www.cagrid.org/wiki/CaGrid:1.3:DeprecationPlan).
4) John sent a note to CVRG. Joshua is working with ONIX. Shannon has started executing on that plan. 
5) Still waiting for Bob Wysong to process the fix.
6) Still on John's plate (no progress).
7) David sent a note last week to get status. Persistent asked for a meeting this Friday. David will schedule and include John, but we are planning to end preview (since it is now almost 6 weeks late).
8) Shannon has finished the updaters for 1.1->1.3 and 1.2->1.3.
9) Scott working on caDSR grid service first. No authorization yet to check updates/deletes -- implementation will depend on time/schedule. 

Action Items
------------
3) John and Scott will review.
10) John will join dev call on Thursday to update/review.
