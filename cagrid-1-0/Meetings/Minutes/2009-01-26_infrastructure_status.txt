Agenda
------
1) Index Service
2) caGrid 1.3 QA 1 Tag
3) Deployment 
4) Documentation
5) QA

Notes
-----
1) Scott has a note out to Mike about how best to accommodate the changes we need to the Index Service (a branch in their cvs, etc). 
2) Does not include BIGIndex, and WebSSO still has outstanding items (due COB Fri 1/30)
3) KC working out deployment process on Training Grid. Should be complete Fri 2/13. 
4) Outline for Admin guide complete. Scott owes outline for the Developer Guide.
5) Discussed timing/approach with Aynur: desktop QA (installer and Introduce) should start immediately. We will meet again on 2/16 to discuss upgrading the QA grid once the KC has worked out the process on the training grid. After the QA grid is upgraded to 1.3, we should re-test a few things and then test WebSSO. Aynur is working to automate the already defined test cases, so regressions can be run automatically.
