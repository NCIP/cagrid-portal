Agenda
------
1) NCI/NCRI Meeting
2) Globus 
3) Taverna Development
4) Taverna Cookbook

Notes
-----
1) Ravi will attend, ARCH will pay. 
2) Meeting scheduled for next Wednesday
3) Design Doc on hold. Did not want to use Taverna provided remote execution service because of security implications. Easier for Taverna content to invoke as another app as opposed to a service. However, proof of concept shows errors b/c of version mismatch of JDOM jar files. WSRF code committed on Taverna side, will be tested continuously as part of their build process. Official release of Taverna 2 is last week of September, and caGrid invocation components will be included. Tech preview of caGrid WF Service in October. Wei's code works standalone with developer preview release.

Action Items
------------
3) Ravi needs to verify approach before he finalizes design doc. John will draft a project plan and circulate.
4) Ravi will review and send comments to Bronwyn.
