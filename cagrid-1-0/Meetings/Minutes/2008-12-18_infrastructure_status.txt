Notes
-----
1) 	Index Service - still has blocking bugs (null points in Xindice), timing issue (which, when fixed, could affect performance). Not ready to roll out, may not be until January. Needs to be done pre-codefreeze. 
	SDK 4.1 Issues - still no release, can't stabilize until then.
	Service updates not done yet
	Issues with Taverna 2 Plugin since T2 Release
	Shannon working on Installer still
	caDSR Grid Service (MMS) - pretty much done, no system test done yet. Not comprehensively tested yet but first cut is done. Need to move Introduce Extensions to use this service not existing (3-5 days remaining). 
	GME semi-stable, authorization still not done (5 days remain). 
2) Partner with KC to test deployment of 1.3 and work out deployment instructions. Start planning early January. 
3) Scott out of the office for two weeks (until Jan 5th).
