Agenda
------
1) caBIG Tools
2) Screen Captures
3) EVS Search mode - EVS search mode/concept-based discovery, auto completion, ontological search
4) Three Queries Sections
5) Using caGrid Into Portlet

Notes
-----
1) Tools come from caBIG website, nothing about individual tools need to be captured 
2) Screen captures need to be replaced. Annotated by another technical writer. Do those call outs need to be maintained?
3) More description on the wiki page (concept-based discovery) http://www.cagrid.org/wiki/Portal:Portal
4) Joshua requested: Aggregate queries, DCQL, and aggregate queries with DCQL. Currently 3 scenarios: No URL or Query, With URL without Query, With URL and Query. 

Manav clarified:
  I. Building Query using Query Builder
  I.a) CQL Queries (existing content, just update screen shots)
  I.b) DCQL Queries 
  I.b.1) aggregate
  I.b.2) distributed (reference: https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/docman/view.php/25/12533/Portal%20QA%20-DCQL.doc)

5) Service Info Popup - upper right hand corner now shows metadata on hover

Action Items
------------
2) Annotations will not be carried forward into replacement screen shots.
3) John will send link to Carolyn for Portal Wiki page and content for hack-a-thon. Carolyn will review and send a PDF draft to Joshua for review and clarification.
4) Manav will extract aggregate queries (I.b.1) from presentation and wiki, aggregate (pun intended) and send to Carolyn by COB 6/13.
