Agenda
------
1) ONIX demo
2) Next steps for interop

Notes
-----
 - ONIX portal is finishing first phase. Prototype is available externally.
 - NCRI has developed a resource catalog model that allows users to find tools,
   projects, services, etc. The intention is that this model could be used
   to describe resources that are available in other efforts such as caBIG,
   and the UK's NHS.
 - All agree that it would be useful if we could exchange general information
   about resources. The caGrid Portal team will try to communicate these ideas
   to other caBIG groups.
 - The ONIX model will likely need some extensions:
   - provenance, service stability
   
Action Items
------------
 - caGrid Portal team will annotate the ONIX model with gaps and suggestions
   based the caBIG use cases.
 - caGrid Portal team will describe some discovery use cases.
