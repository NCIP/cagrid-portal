Agenda
------
1) Status of 1.3
2) Testing Scenarios
3) Documentation
4) Deployment Process
5) Schedule: QA/Stage/Prod

Notes
-----
1)	Scott: Updated BIGIndex->caGrid-Index and testing for scale and outstanding bugs ("going well"). Code changes needed for backwards compatibility. Finalizing movement of Introduce extensions that used old caDSR and GME to use new MMS and GME service (90% complete). Concern: lack of real data to test against, may be an issue once we get into QA. GME will not have full authorization model in this release, can implement once workflow is pinned down. 
	Steve: Everything is done, moving to Documentation phase, verifying that system tests still work. 
	Shannon: Introduce frozen for a while, used to upgrade all services to 1.3 except for FQP (next day or two) and BPEL. Transfer Service needed an upgrader which David needed for FQP. Once that's done, FQP can use it to upgrade. Installer refactor is done, reorganized to be less dependent from release-to-release. Coming to end of coding phase and moving into testing phase. May add some security niceties (fetch host certs from within Installer w/o using GAARDS-UI) if there is time. 
	David: Changes to data service extension to support Scott's changes to GME and MMS (large refactor but going well). FQP needs to be upgraded to 1.3 (next day or so). SDK 4.1 support progressing since Satish's last 4.1.1 RC. 
	Santhosh: WebSSO has 2 RFEs - loading multiple auth services in login screen (done), system testing (final round of writing junit test cases for it). 
	Ravi: On target for code freeze. caGrid plugin is well integration with T2 workbench. Wei has finished unit tests for plugin + Taverna. Taverna is integrating those tests into Taverna's nightly builds. Making a change to Taverna to use WS-Notification to subscribe for updates. BPEL still needs to be upgraded to 1.3.
2) Spreadsheet -- not wiki -- should be updated (Shannon checked in: $CVS_ROOT\Documentation\docs\testing\Test Cases_caGrid_1.3.xls)
3) Scott and John will meet with Carolyn on Wednesday to go over guides, discuss what will change (magnitude), and cover best way to revise and to author new material. Developers should begin documentation updates after code freeze.
4) Systems Team is agreeable to adding new VMs, though App Scan will be required (so the sooner a 1.3 snapshot is in either DEV or QA tiers at NCI, sooner that can be scheduled). They owe us a summary of what hardware may/may not need replacing, and how they'd like to approach the upgrades. John and Kevin meet with them again at the end of January to follow up and discuss the deployment of 1.3 to the higher tiers. 
5) QA scheduled to begin their testing on 1/26. Scott and John should meet with Aynur and Ye prior to or on 1/26 to review what will be tested and how. QA should end first week of March based on current estimates.

Action Items
------------
1) John will ask Charles Griffen: When will there be instance data of UML to XML binding in caDSR to test against?
   John will follow up with Ravi on Wednesday to verify when will BPEL service be upgraded to 1.3?
Testing Scenarios - make sure spread sheet and wiki page converge
