# Email delivery on broken builds
# DeliverBrokenBuildEmail should be a list of models (e.g. Nightly)
#   for which email should be sent. If this variable is set, _all_
#   the other options must be set.
# SMTPMailhost: the outgoing mail server
#   when necessary
# EmailFrom: the from address of the email
# DartboardBaseURL: the "Testing" directory of the dashboard URL
# EmailProjectName: the name of the project
# BuildMonitors: a list of people to whom the email if cc'ed. Each element
#   of the list has three parts: site regexp, buildname regexp, and set of
#   email addresses. For example,
#     BuildMonitors: {.* .* A} {foo\.bar .* B} {.* WinNT C}
#   would cause A to be notified of all build errors, B of all errors with
#   builds from *.foo.bar, and C of all errors on WinNT.
# CVSIdentToEmail: a list of rules for converting CVS identities into
#   email addresses. A list of pairs of {regexp substitution} are
#   used. The first regexp to match specifies which subsitution to use.
#   For example
#     CVSIndentToEmail: {robotuser DO_NOT_EMAIL} {.* {\0@somewhere.net} }
#   would mean that robotuser is not mailed, and every other user is
#   at somehwere.net
# DeliverBrokenBuildEmailWithConfigureFailures: Set to 1 if
#   you want email delivered for Build Warnings (Normally 1)
# DeliverBrokenBuildEmailWithBuildErrors: Set to 1 if you want
#   email delivered for Build Errors (Normally 1)
# DeliverBrokenBuildEmailWithBuildWarnings: Set to 1 if you
#   want email delivered for Build Warnings (Normally 0)
# DeliverBrokenBuildEmailWithTestNotRuns: Set to 1 if you
#   want email delivered for Build Warnings (Normally 0)
# DeliverBrokenBuildEmailWithTestFailures: Set to 1 if you
#   want email delivered for Build Warnings (Normally 0)
