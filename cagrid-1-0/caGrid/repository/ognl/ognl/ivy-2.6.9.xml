		<description homepage="https://ognl.dev.java.net/">OGNL stands for Object-Graph Navigation
			Language; it is an expression language for getting and setting properties of Java
			objects. You use the same expression for both getting and setting the value of a
			property. The ognl.Ognl class contains convenience methods for evaluating OGNL
			expressions. You can do this in two stages, parsing an expression into an internal form
			and then using that internal form to either set or get the value of a property; or you
			can do it in a single stage, and get or set a property using the String form of the
			expression directly. OGNL started out as a way to set up associations between UI
			components and controllers using property names. As the desire for more complicated
			associations grew, Drew Davidson created what he called KVCL, for Key-Value Coding
			Language, egged on by Luke Blanshard. Luke then reimplemented the language using ANTLR,
			came up with the new name, and, egged on by Drew, filled it out to its current state.
			Later on Luke again reimplemented the language using JavaCC. Further maintenance on all
			the code is done by Drew (with spiritual guidance from Luke). We pronounce OGNL as a
			word, like the last syllables of a drunken pronunciation of "orthogonal." </description>
