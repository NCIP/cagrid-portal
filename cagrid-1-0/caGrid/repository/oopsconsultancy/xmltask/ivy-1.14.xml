		<description homepage="http://www.oopsconsultancy.com/software/xmltask/"> xmltask provides
			the facility for automatically editing XML files as part of an Ant build. Unlike the
			standard filter task provided with Ant, it is XML-sensitive, but doesn't require you to
			define XSLTs. Uses include: * modifying configuration files for applications during
			builds * inserting/removing information for J2EE deployment descriptors * dynamically
			building Ant build.xml files during builds * building and maintaining websites built
			with XHTML * driving Ant via a meta build.xml to abstract out build processes
