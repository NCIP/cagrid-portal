		<description homepage="http://jtds.sourceforge.net/"> jTDS is an open source 100% pure Java
			(type 4) JDBC 3.0 driver for Microsoft SQL Server (6.5, 7, 2000 and 2005) and Sybase
			(10, 11, 12, 15). jTDS is based on FreeTDS and is currently the fastest production-ready
			JDBC driver for SQL Server and Sybase. jTDS is 100% JDBC 3.0 compatible, supporting
			forward-only and scrollable/updateable ResultSets, concurrent (completely independent)
			Statements and implementing all the DatabaseMetaData and ResultSetMetaData methods.
			Check out the feature matrix for more details. Quite a few of the commercial JDBC
			drivers out there are based on jTDS (or FreeTDS), even if they no longer acknowledge
			this. jTDS has been tested with virtually all JDBC-based database management tools and
			is the driver of choice for most of these (recommended for DbVisualizer and SQuirreL
			SQL, distributed with Aqua Data Studio and DataDino). jTDS is also becoming a common
			choice for enterprise-level applications: it passes both the J2EE 1.3 certification and
			Hibernate test suites, and is recommended for JBoss, Hibernate, Atlassian JIRA and
			Confluence and Compiere.</description>
