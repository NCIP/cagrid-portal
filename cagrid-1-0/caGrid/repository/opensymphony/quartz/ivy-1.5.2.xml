        <description homepage="http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/"> Quartz is a full-featured, open
            source job scheduling system that can be integrated with, or used along side virtually
            any J2EE or J2SE application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the largest
            e-commerce system. Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for
            executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are
            defined as standard Java components or EJBs. The Quartz Scheduler includes many
            enterprise-class features, such as JTA transactions and clustering. Quartz is freely
            usable, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.</description>
