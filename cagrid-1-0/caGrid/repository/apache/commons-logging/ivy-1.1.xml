		<description homepage="http://commons.apache.org/logging/">When writing a library it is very
			useful to log information. However there are many logging implementations out there, and
			a library cannot impose the use of a particular one on the overall application that the
			library is a part of. The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different
			logging implementations. A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with
			any logging implementation at runtime. Commons-logging comes with support for a number
			of popular logging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a reasonably
			simple task. Applications (rather than libraries) may also choose to use
			commons-logging. While logging-implementation independence is not as important for
			applications as it is for libraries, using commons-logging does allow the application to
			change to a different logging implementation without recompiling code. Note that
			commons-logging does not attempt to initialise or terminate the underlying logging
			implementation that is used at runtime; that is the responsibility of the application.
			However many popular logging implementations do automatically initialise themselves; in
			this case an application may be able to avoid containing any code that is specific to
			the logging implementation used.</description>
