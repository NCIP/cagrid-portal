        <description homepage="http://jakarta.apache.org/jcs/">he Java Caching System, JCS is a
            distributed caching system written in java. It is intended to speed up applications by
            providing a means to manage cached data of various dynamic natures. Like any caching
            system, JCS is most useful for high read, low put applications. Latency times drop
            sharply and bottlenecks move away from the database in an effectively cached
        system.</description>
