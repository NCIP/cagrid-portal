            >The Subject API is a technology developed jointly by the Signet and Grouper Projects to
            integrate a java application with a site's existing Identity Management operations. It
            enables any type of object whose identity is being managed - person, group, application,
            computer, etc - to be presented to that application without requiring the application to
            be specifically designed for particular object types or with knowledge of how those
            objects are stored and represented. Those details form the configuration of the Subject
            API. </description>
