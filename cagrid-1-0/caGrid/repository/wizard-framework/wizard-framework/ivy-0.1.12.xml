		<description homepage="https://wizard-framework.dev.java.net/">A Swing wizard library for
			Java based on a WizardModel and a number of WizardSteps. The library comes with three
			models that can be extended, they are as follows. * StaticModel - The most basic model.
			* DynamicModel - Similar to the static model, except that steps can be skiped
			dynamically at runtime based on the users response. * MultiPathModel - The most complex
			model, similar to the dynamic model, except that steps are grouped into paths, and paths
			are linked together. </description>
