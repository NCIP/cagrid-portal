1)
Unfortunatly, I'm somewhat stuck until the SDK team gets this fixed:
	https://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=17856&group_id=148&atid=730
	SDK team is working on this; apparently patched the bug and is preparing to QA test it.
2)
SDK's internal CQL query handling returns instances of subclasses of the data type you queried for.  This obviously breaks CQL spec, but some clients may want this behavior.
	Added a configurable parameter to use strict CQL processing or not.  Defaults to 'true'
3)
Use information already provided by the SDK to assign schema element name / Java classname mappings
	The castor mapping file at least has this.
	Better approach than making the assumption that Classname == Element Name
