Notes:
=====
- Building against GT 4.0.2 tag

Issues:
=======

Looking at ws-transfer specification:

1) Definition lacks a port name.
2) No part element for Empty message, GT tooling fails to process WSDL

As per discussion, modified WSDL to work with GT tooling.

Questions
==========

- Where should the code live ?
- Package names for the code ?
- How do we push feedback on ws-transfer interface to authors ?

Transfer Service Prototype
==========================

This service provides functionality to retrieve an arbitrary
resource. This implementation only supports the "get" method and
returns a xsd:any XML blob. The service uses a URI as the resource
key, which can be potentially reused as the Endpoint Identifier (EPI).

The transfer service interacts with the data applicatoin to actually
retrieve the data. The service allows for the data application to
register an object that implements the
org.globus.transfer.DataServiceInterface. The resource key (which is a
URI) and the distingushed name of the client is passed as parameter to
a method invocation on the registered object. The XML blob
representing the resource is retrieved and returned the to client.

Implementaion Details
======================

The service code is checked into playground/java/ws-transfer

(A) To deploy the service:
--------------------------

(1) set GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/GT/4.0.2/install
(2) cd playground/java/ws-transfer
(3) ant deploy
(4) ant javadocs (to generate java docs)

(B) To configure the service:
------------------------------

The default configuration has the key qname set to URI and that is
required for EPIs to be used as key.

The key name can be configured by modifying parameter
"resourceKeyName" in
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_transfer_service/deploy-jndi-config.xml

(C) To test the service:
------------------------

(0) Valid credentials are required to test the service
(1) set GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/GT/4.0.2/install
(2) cd playground/java/ws-transfer/service/java/test
(3) ant test

(D) To run integrated tests (ws-resolution and ws-transfer service)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

These test configure the resolution service such that EPI is resolved
as EPR to transfer service.

(1) set GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/GT/4.0.2/install
(2) cd playground/java/ws-transfer
(3) ant deployAll
(4) cd playground/java/ws-transfer/service/java/test
(5) ant integratedTest

(E) To integrate with Data Application
---------------------------------------

(1) Implement the org.globus.transfer.DataServiceInterface.
(2) Create an instance of (1) and register with service. Following API
can be used to do that:
        org.globus.transfer.util.ResolutionUtil.registerDataService()
(3) Note that the Transfer service and the Data Application should
be in same JVM.
