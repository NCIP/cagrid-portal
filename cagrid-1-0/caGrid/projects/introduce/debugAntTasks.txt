Debugging Custom Ant Tasks in Eclipse 
To achieve this: 
Set a breakpoint in your custom Ant task code. 
Open the launch configuration dialog on the Ant config for this build 
Go to the JRE tab 
In the VM arguments specify for the VM to launch to enable remote debug: 
-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000 
The Ant build will launch and wait for a remote debug attach 
Top level Run menu>Debug.. 
Create a new Remote Java Application launch configuration 
Set the source lookup path as required for your code

You should hit your breakpoint and be able to step through the code to  
determine what is the root problem.
