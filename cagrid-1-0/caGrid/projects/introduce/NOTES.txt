To Do:

Need to make Configuration Menu work... should be able to set appropriate services URLs, etc

need "Up" and "Down" buttons for the order of the tables (operations, method params, etc)

parameter names and not being made unique when you add them... double click "string" twice as an input param

need to make jndi edited, not replaced everytime.

introduce build needs to make more granular jars (for linking), how about:
	-caGrid-introduce-core-1.0.jar  		(everything in src/java/Introduce) 
	-caGrid-introduce-core-tests-1.0.jar  	(everything in test/src/java/Introduce)
	-caGrid-introduce-portal-1.0.jar  		(everything in src/java/Portal)
	-caGrid-introduce-portal-tests-1.0.jar 	(everything in test/src/java/Portal)

(steve)
Open a service with no security. Go to service security, click custom, check all the options for secure communication.  Go to authz tab, select grid map.
Now click back on the Operations tab, and click modify to modify a method.
It gives an appropriate error “No Grid Map File Specified!!!” and dumps this exception, but the problem is there is no context as to where to fix the problem.  It should at least set the security tab as the active tab, and go to the authorization tab.

since you cant edit anything on any security tabs unless you have checked custom, all tabs should be disabled
when you check custom, it should only enable the secure communication tab (as you cant edit any tabs until you check a form of secure com)
when you check some for of secure comm, the other tabs should be enabled.

we could support definition of "service properties" in introduce
-serviceimpl would have gettters for them (pull them out of service context for them)
-we would could write them into the wsdd

type browser issues:
-(DONE)you can and shouldn't be able to remove the XML schema schema
-it shouldn't let you remove schema types that are being used by inputs,outputs,or metadata
-(DONE)it lets you set the package name for XML schema schema, and shouldn't
-(DONE)it lets you set the location for XML schema schema, and shouldn't
-(DONE)it lets you set the class name for XML schema types; does that work?
-(DONE)does it really support editing the location of a schema? if it does, it needs to move the file that was pulled down from the gme (otherwise it wont exist)

you should be able to open up an empty introduce.xml document (with no elements), currently null pointers happen in methods and types

when modifying a service, conneciton to GME needs to happen in the background, and fail gracefully

Need to fix commontools to read some preference to set the rule to use for namespace mapping, right now its hardcoded as below:
	//TODO: where should this mapperClassname preference be set
	String mapperClassname = "gov.nih.nci.cagrid.common.CaBIGNames2paceToPackageMapper";

Need to add more complex tests to the system test for adding complex methods with faults etc.

secure message privacy does not work (STEVE)

support for open saml callouts and everything that globus supports (STEVE)

============================ D O N E ================================================================
==========

(DONE) need a way to generate XSD and beanmappers for existing object models that want to use default de/serialization

(DONE - still need to add tests.. and GUI - Scott) sync serializer/deserializer

	SchemaElement needs to have location and type always and have a choice between:
	complex type with nothing
	and one with className serializer and deserializer
	
	
	can be used to build:
	<typeMapping qname="(from Namespace namespace, and SchemaElement type)"
	languageSpecificType="java:(from Namespace packageName+.+SchemaElement className)"
	serializer="(from SchemaElement serializer)"
	deserializer="(from SchemaElement deserializer)" encodingStyle=""/>
	
	editors will look for:
	<!-- START INTRODUCE TYPEMAPPINGS -->
	if it exists, it dump the type mappings from its start, replacing evertying in the file until finding:
	<!-- END INTRODUCE TYPEMAPPINGS -->
	
	if the tag isn't found, the tags (and type mappings) will be added to the end of the file (in appropriate location for server and client)
	
==========

(DONE) Shannon, did your refactor break the functionality of synchronizeMetadataFramework in the MetadataListType?

(DONE) BaseResource bug that Mike and Steve found.  Make new service with secure conv. and keep the initial
settings.  Use a proxy created from Dorian in the credentials section.  Stand up globus without security.
--seems the AuthenticationService intercepts the intial call, then rewrites the resourcecontext targetService to be itself... this causes the resourcehome to break
  --need to see why it does this, and if there is a work around
  
(DONE) need to put a validator on the param name, it must be java valid......

Need to make better use of org.apache.axis.utils.JavaUtils
 -(DONE) checking for primatives
 -(DONE) checking for reserved keywords for things like method and param names

(DONE)probably need to separate out the namespacetopackage mapping definitions from each output/input/metadata as it is now, as its really a service level thing
	-we need a separate tab to define the mappings; this will probably be needed for custom serialization too

(DONE - its fine, as we need to write to it for type mappings) is client-config.wsdd really needed in the root dir?  can't you just add GLOBUS_LOCATION to your classpath

(DONE) Method modification window needs an overhaul....

(DONE) The GME Browser screen does not scroll correctly.

(DONE) when using a non-bean response object, the wsdl writter is broken.  It assumes the element name is "response".  It should assume it is the className

(DONE) if introduce.jar and the like is removed from the service and expected to be run from elsewhere, introduce will need to check that it supports the version of 
introduce.xml that the service uses.  We need to either have a "version" attribute in the document, or use the xmlns to decide the version.
(probably should add a version attribute as the behavior could change without the dcoument structure changing).

(DONE) Need to be able to roll back "created" version 0.

(DONE) When creating a new service be sure to remove all the old zips from teh resource directory....

(DONE) If it could not delete the dir prior to creation then warn and exit.

(DONE I think this was an overall issue) Code generation is broken for custom class definition when isArray is true (doesn't add array def in all places)

(DONE- fixed with streamgobbler) Make a method, save, add code to client and impl, modify name of input parameter, save, build error when trying to remove method and then unable to delete directory.

(DONE) When introduce adds new methods it shouldn't add a "return null;" it should add the following (even if its a void method):
	throw new RemoteException("Not yet implemented");

(DONE) How about changing this "@created by caGrid toolkit version 0.5"

(DONE) MUST FIX THE WHITESPACE SENSTIVE CODE FINDER!!!

(DONE ++++   NEEDS TESTED  ++++++++) when you download a schema that has dependencies, the dependant schemas are not added to the namespace to package mappings... you need to parse every schema (and imported schema), looking for imports, and make sure each imported schema has a mapping
- the namespaceExclude code needs to be updated when this is supported too.
- there no "good" way to do it, but the process should be to exclude any namespace that is imported from a schema that is excluded
  - basically just exclude any namespace that is included from a schema for a namespace that is being excluded (recursively)

(DONE) Last Saved in service properties should display as a normal looking Date/Time

(DONE) Operations list should display as a standard looking method: e.g.  void foo(A a, B b)
 

(DONE) need to NOT generate stubs for schemas that the user specifies the class to use... this is important as it will/could generate classes with exact same name and cause the service to break
-- still need to handle imported schemas, but so do the rest of the code (package mappings, etc)

(DONE) Click Modifiy Service, Click Save, Click Cancel or No, Save Progress comes up.

(DONE) Create service needs to check that the directory they select is empty.  If not, should prompt and ask if it is ok to delete the dir and recreate it.

(DONE)Click Modify Service Click Cancel, Null pointer.

(DONE) Make sure that skeleton names entered in the GUI are acceptable.
	i.e. No Service in the name (fixed 12/7/05)
		 No non-acceptable characters for java class names

(DONE) Enable service to back up old service skeleton before altering and then provide rollback capabilities.
	i.e. Enable "undo" in the gui.

(DONE) Map the ext/NStoPkg.mappings with those in the skeleton (right now they are copied into the skeleton's file)

(DONE) namespace to package mappings should be jettemplated at sync time

(DONE) Metadata and registration configuration


================================================================================
Need to verify we can achieve literal mapping between caDSR definition, XML serialization, and generated bean model
(we need to create a simple one of these, and add it to the specification document)

Example Model:
org.foo.A
  -org.foo.B b;
  -org.foo.C c;

XML (with appropriate namespaces of course):
<A>
  <B/>
  <C/>
<A>

Java Model:
org.foo
  -A {B b; C c;}
  -B
  -C
================================================================================




(*STARTED*  need to add more)Add gui testing (requires a HEAD to run)

Make notes on how to add a new template.

Need to validate the model before we begin to do code gen
	-- will reduce bugs and bug checking
	-- validate that the package names and classnames are being set correctly
	--VALIDATION:
		-unique method names
		-unique metadata qnames
		-run schema validation?
		-others?
	
(DONE)Need to support "MODIFIED" methods.
	-- support for changing of 
		-- output type
		-- number and type of parameters
		-- number and types of faults
	
	
(DONE) GMEMetadataConfigurationComponent needs to set proper view on viewing an existing one from "modify"

(DONE) add packageName as a seperate parameter so that we can handle the funny mappings that we will use for caDSR->GME schemas.....

(DONE) Because we are now using axis to generate the class names we will not be able to use synctool to always find out which methods are different.  We will need a better method.
		-- we do not need to know them upfront because we dont need to analyze the signatures, only look at the method names.

(DONE using sync tools to populate empty classnames) Need to be able to not only use Axis for the classnames but also use the users classnames if they provide there own beans or api.

(DONE Need to fix the browse screen so that it can work with paths that have spaces in them.

(DONE) Need to make sure that the id's used to created archives are good from date through time.

(DONE) Need to pull the namespace to mappings code out of the gui and into the template.

(DONE) moved the sync tools over to use beans instead of using DOM.  Much cleaner an easier to maintain.
