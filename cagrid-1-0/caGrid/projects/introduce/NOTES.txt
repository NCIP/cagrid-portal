To Do:
Make sure that skeleton names entered in the GUI are acceptable.
	i.e. No Service in the name (fixed 12/7/05)
		 No non-acceptable characters for java class names

Enable service to back up old service skeleton before altering and then provide rollback capabilities.
	i.e. Enable "undo" in the gui.
	
Security configuration

Metadata and registration configuration

Make notes on how to add a new template.
