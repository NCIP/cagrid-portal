To Do:
(DONE) Make sure that skeleton names entered in the GUI are acceptable.
	i.e. No Service in the name (fixed 12/7/05)
		 No non-acceptable characters for java class names

Enable service to back up old service skeleton before altering and then provide rollback capabilities.
	i.e. Enable "undo" in the gui.

(DONE) Map the ext/NStoPkg.mappings with those in the skeleton (right now they are copied into the skeleton's file)
	
Security configuration

Metadata and registration configuration

Make notes on how to add a new template.
