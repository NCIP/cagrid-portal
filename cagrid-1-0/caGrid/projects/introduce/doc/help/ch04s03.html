                    (i.e., from other portTypes). This notion is called <span class="emphasis"><em>compositional
                        inheritance</em></span>. Services under the new WSDL 2.0 specification cannot
                    extend portType definit ons. In order to simulate portType extension Introduce
                    implements the ability to copy <span class="emphasis"><em>operation</em></span> descriptions from
                    other portTypes and put them in the service&#8217;s own description. When using this
                    feature, there are various configuration option the engine must know such as the
                    namespaces of the operations, and whether or not an implementation of the
                    operations are already provided or should be genefated stubbed just as any other
                    Introduce defined operation.</p><p>In order to be sure that the operation can be correctly imported and copied
                    into the new portType, the WSDL of this operation and any referenced schemas
                    must be brought into this new service and imported. If the operation
                    implementation is not being provided, the synchronization engine must add this
                    operation to the services base interface, and the ln-boxing Globus wrapper for
                    this operation must be generated. If the implementation of this operation is
                    being provided, the extra code in the interface, its implementation, and the
                    wrapper do not need to be added. However, the implementation code, in the form
                    of a JAR file, must be brought into the new service, and the operation class
                    must be added to the WSDD of this service.<a name="_Ref136844302"></a></p></div></body></html>
