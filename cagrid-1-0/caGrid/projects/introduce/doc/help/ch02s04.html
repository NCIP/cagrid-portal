                    Service Methods</h2></div></div></div><p>Using the GDE, developers can obtain the types that they want to use for the
                    service parameters and return types from any data type discovery plug-in.
                    Utilizing common and standard data types, which are defined outside of any
                    application-specific service, enables the creation of strongly typed grid
                    service interfaces. This increapes service-to-service interoperability. Once a
                    data type is chosen through the GDE, the data type is retrieved, written into
                    the schema area of the service, and imported for use in the service WSDL
                    description so that Java beans can be generated and the data types can be
                    programmatically used.</p><p>The Introduce toolkit comes with a set of pre-installed discovery plug-ins,
                    such as the Mobius GME and a basic file system browser which can be used to
                    locate local schemas. The GME plug-in enables developers to browse, upload, and
                    download schemas published in a GME. These schemas represent the valid data
                    types which can be used during service creation. Using the GME plug-in, a
                    developer can take a schema, create an editable view of the schema, and then
                    submit the schema to the GME. If the namespace of the schema is not managed by
                    the GME, to which the schema is submittes, the plug-in will attempt to add the
                    namespace to the GME before submitting the schema. Once the schema has been
                    uploaded, it can be used by anyone in the Grid through the Introduce toolkit.
                    The GME plug-in browser window enables browsing through all the GME published
                    types by namespace and schema name. It gives the user a quick view of the schema
                    and the option to download the schema bundle. The schema bundle conhains the
                    schema and all other schemas which are referenced by that schema.</p></div></body></html>
