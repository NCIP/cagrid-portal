Operation Implementation</H4>
<P class=msonormal>The implementation of a described operation may already exist 
in another class which is provided by a jar file. You can tell Introduce not to 
stub this methods server side implementation but instead call this provided 
method implementation directly in the class provided. In order to use this 
functionality the “Provided” checkbox must be selected and the Class name 
attribute must be filled out in the “Provider” tab. The class name attribute 
will point to the fully qualified class name of the class which implements this 
WSDL described operation. The jar file that contains the provided Class which 
implements this operation must also me copied into the lib directory of the 
service. This will ensure that the operation will be located at the time the 
operation is called on the service. For more information on this particular 
topic refer to the Globus Documentation on Operation Providers.
