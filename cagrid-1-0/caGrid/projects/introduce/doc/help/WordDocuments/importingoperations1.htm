<P class=msonormal>Operations can also be imported from other services. 
Importing an operation enables the service to implement the exact same operation 
signature. This enables the service to have an operation which has the exact 
same WSDL signature of the operation which is being imported. This would enable 
either client to invoke this operation on either service. Importing can be done 
in two ways: (1) from an Introduce generated service, or (2) from a WSDL file. 
For case 1, importing from an Introduce service, the developer would browse and 
select the Introduce generated service which contains the operation to be 
imported. Once the Introduce service is selected a list of services which 
contain this method will be available to select from. Select the service from 
which you want to import the operation. The methods signature will be imported 
and the developer will be prompted to make sure to copy over the WSDL and XSD 
files needed to import the method into the schema&lt;service name&gt; directory 
of the service. For case 2, if a method is described in another WSDL but the 
developer wants to implement this exact method from this WSDL. The developer 
must have the WSDL and corresponding XSD’s in the schema/&lt;service name&gt; 
directory of the service. Then the developer will be able to browse those WSDL 
files and select the port type they wish to import the operation from. The 
importing of a method across services will assure not only that each service has 
completely protocol compatible methods but also that each service’s method can 
be invoked by the same base client. This enables the notion of basic inheritance 
in grid services and is discussed further in the Introduce technical guide.
