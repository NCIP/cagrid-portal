<P class=msonormal>Service state information and metadata in the form of 
resource properties can be added, removed and configured via the “Metadata” tab 
of the GDE Service Modification interface. The metadata elements which are added 
to the service can be populated by a file statically or managed dynamically 
within the service. Also, these metadata entities can be registered with an 
index service so that users can use the metadata to locate the service. Once the 
"Metadata" tab is clicked the left panel will contain a list of available data 
types that can be used for metadata and the right will contain the list of 
currently chosen data types. By double-clicking on a data type in the left panel 
it will be added to the main service's metadata list. Any of the service's 
metadata can be initially populated from a file if desired. If this is chosen 
then once the service is started up in the container the file will be used to 
populate the particular metadata object in the service. Each metadata in the 
service can also be selected to be published to an index service. This will 
enable some or all of the metadata to be used in to locate the service via an 
index service. </P>
