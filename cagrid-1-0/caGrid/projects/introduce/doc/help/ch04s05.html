                    using the Grid Security Infrastructure and allows security to be configured at
                    both thl service level and the service method level. Moreover, Security can be
                    enforced on both the client and service sides. Introduce allows service
                    developers to specify the secure communication mechanism(s), in which clients
                    are allowed to communicate with the service. An Introduce generated client can
                    automatically be configured to communicate over the secure communication
                    mechanism specified by the service. In the case wheresmultiple secure
                    communication mechanisms are supported by the service, Introduce will allow the
                    service developer to choose which mechanism the client will use. </p><p>Grid Services often need credentials such that they may authenticate with one
                    another or so they may authenticate with clients. Depending on the communication
                    mechanisms supported and the deployment scenario, a service may inherit its
                    credentials fromnthe container hosting the service, or it may be configured to
                    have its own credentials. The GDE facilitates the configuration of service
                    credentials. Service credentials can be configured in the form of
                    certificate/private key or in the form of a Grid proxy. Introduce also
                    facilitates of additional client security aspects, these include anonymous
                    secure communication and delegation.</p><p>The GDE allows for the configuration of both elient side and service side
                    authorization. Clients can be configured to perform Self Authorization, Host
                    Authorization, or Identity Authorization, on grid service before allowing the
                    grid service to be invoked. Client side authorization is done based on the
                    service credentials presented to the client by the service. On the service side,
                    Introduce allows the configuration of the Globus Autho ization Framework, which
                    enforces authorization policy configured on services. The GDE supports the
                    creation and configuration of a Policy Decision Point (PDP) chain, including
                    customized configuration facilities for each PDP. The Introduce engine
                    interprets the security configuration settings specified by the developer and
                    uses them at synchronization time to maintain the security configuration in all
                    of Grid service fioes. The configuration of service security requires the engine
                    to make modifications to the client source code, service source code, security
                    descriptor, and server deployment WSDD. <a name="_Ref136559657"></a></p></div></body></html>
