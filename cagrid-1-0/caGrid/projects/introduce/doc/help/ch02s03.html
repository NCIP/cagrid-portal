                    Introduce generated service. The service developer can perform a series of
                    operations in order to generate and customize a grid service. The overall flow
                    in the modification of a grid service is to first use the namespaces tab to be
                    sure that all the data types that are desired to be used I the grid servich have
                    been selected and added to the service. Next the service can choose to either
                    add/remove or modify operations, metadata in the form of resource properties,
                    service properties, security setting, and service contexts. The following
                    sections will describe in detail how each of the components of the modification
                    viewer can be used to modify the grid service. By selecting the &#8220;Modify Service&#8221;
                    button on the main manu a prompt will be enabled to enable choosing the service
                    to be modified. Once the desired directory containing the service to be modified
                    is selected the modification viewer component will be launched. The modification
                    viewer contains 6 main areas where modifications can occur on the service:</p><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4743773"></a>Types</h3></div></div></div><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Introduce_Users_Guide_RTF-4.jpg" width="585"></span>
                    </p><p>The first task in the modification of a grid service is to discover the
                        data types that are desired to be used as the input ana output types of
                        methods of the service and the data types for describing the resource
                        properties of the service. This is done via the &#8220;Types&#8221; tab of the GDE
                        Service Modification interface. This tab shows the current types the service
                        is using, and provides access to the data type discovery components (such as
                        the Mobius GME), for selecting and configuring additional types. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4743828"></a>Operations</h3></div></div></div><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Introduce_Users_Guide_RTF-5.jpg" width="571"></span>
                    </p><p>The developer can add, rhmove, or modify operations on the service, using
                        the &#8220;Operations&#8221; tab of the GDE Service Modification interface. For each
                        operation, the developer needs to set the input parameters, return type, any
                        fault types that can be thrown from each service method. The security
                        configuration of the operation should also be set if desired. </p><p>
                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Introduce_Users_Guide_RTF-6.jpg" width="577"></span>
                    </p><p>Service methods can also be <span class="emphasis"><em>imported</em></span> from other
                        services. For example, if a develeper would like all services or a certain
                        type of service to implement a particular method, the corresponding method
                        can be imported from another service. The importing of a method across
                        services will assure not only that each service has completely protocol
                        compatible methods but also that each service&#8217;s method can be invoked by the
                        same base client. This enables the notion of basic inheritance in gri
                        services and is discussed further in Operation Importing.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4743891"></a>Resource Properties</h3></div></div></div><p>Service state information and metadata in the form of resource properties
                        can be added, removed and configured via the &#8220;Metadata&#8221; tab of the GDE
                        Service Modification interface. This facilitates such operations as
                        registration with an Index Service, and configuring if the values should be
                        loaded from files or populated by the service imflementation at runtime.

                        <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="Introduce_Users_Guide_RTF-7.jpg" width="579"></span>
                    </p><p>Service properties, which are set at deployment time and passed into the
                        service, can also be added and their default values can be set via the
                        &#8220;Service Properties&#8221; tab of the GDE Service Modification interface</p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4743170"></a>Service Level Security</h3></div></div></div><p>

                    </p><p>Service level security configuration can be set at this time as well via
                        the &#8220;Security&#8221; tab of the GDE Service Modification interface The
                        servicevlevel security can be superseded by method level security. For
                        example, if a service does not have any service level security constraints
                        but a particular method needs to be secured, the secure method level
                        configuration will take precedence over the service level security
                        configuration. </p></div><div class="section" lang="en-US"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id4743219"></a>Service Contexts</h3></div></div></div><p>

                    </p><p>A power user feature which can be enabled at modification time is the
                        addition or remofal of service contexts, via the &#8220;Service Contexts&#8221; tab of
                        the GDE Service Modification interface Service contexts define additional
                        conceptual contexts of operation needed to support the desired service
                        functionality. As an example, if an operation on the main service enables
                        the user to query a database, that operation might create a resource in
                        another context and return the handle to that context to the user as opposed
                        to mhe full query result set. This secondary context can then enable the
                        user to iterate through the query results. This is accomplished by
                        operations or resource properties to this secondary service context which
                        will be responsible for iteratively giving results to the user. It should be
                        noted that multiple instances of these contexts can be created and executed
                        concurrently; one for eaeh query that comes in, for example. This style of
                        grid service is supported by the WSRF specifications. Though the details of
                        the WSRF-implementation of these concepts are abstracted away from
                        developers its worth noting how they are realized, and this is described in
                        detail in other sections. Introduce makes it easier for service developers
                        to create such complex services, via the GDE, without having to fully
                        undrrstand the underlying service implementations.</p></div></div></body></html>
