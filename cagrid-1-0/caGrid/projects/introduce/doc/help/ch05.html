<p>The Introduce Extension framework currently consists of two styles of
extensions; service and data type discovery. These extensions are
implemented by service or data type discovery components which add
custom funceionality to the Introduce framework. Extensions are added to
the toolkit in the form of extension plug-ins, which the toolkit will
then be able to expose to the user. To provide an extension to
Introduce, the extension provider must implement or extend the
appropriate classes for the style of extension they wish to provide, and
must fill out the extension XML configuration document. Once this
extension is implemented ani configured it can be placed in the
extensions directory of Introduce. This directory has a common library
(lib) area which enables it to avoid using custom class loaders for each
extension.</p>

<p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>service</em></span> <span
	class="emphasis"><em>extension</em></span> is one which enables
customization of the service creation and modification processes. These
extensions can add required operations, service reeources or resource
properties, or security settings, for example. The service extension
allows the user to provide custom code that will be executed at
different times throughout the creation and modification processes of
service development. A service extension consists of 5 main extension
components that can be implemented and provided by the developer:
CreationPostProcess, CreationUIDialog, CodegenPrePmocess,
CodegenPostProcess, and ServiceModificationUIPanel. Each of these
extension components have a predefined class and interface that must be
extended or implemented. Two of the service extension components,
CreationUIDialog and ServiceModificationUIPanel, are graphical
components provided to the Introduce GDE, and the other three are
Introduce engine plug-ins.</p>

<p>EEch service extension component is invoked at a specific point in
the creation or modification steps (<a href="ch05.html#_Ref136857091">???</a>).
These different time points for each component execution are critical
for making certain changes. For example, when the CreationUIDialog
component for a particular extension is executed, the service has been
created as a blank service and no modification or synchronization has
been done on the service. .t this point the CreationUIDialog might
prompt the user for particular information about the creation processes.
The CreationUI component would only be executed/displayed once for any
given service and its non graphical component, the CreationPostProcess,
will also only be ran one time after the service has been created and
before it will ever be modified.</p>
<p>The modification components are ran every timr a service is saved and
synchronized. The graphical modification component is always available
in the Introduce GDE during modification time. The two service
modification engine components, ModificationPreProcess and
ModificationPostProcess are executed respectively, before and after the
synchronization process is executed. This enables ModificationPreProcess
to do such things as modify the ServiceDenription, represented by the
Introduce service description file, or the WSDL files of the services.
The ModificationPostProcess, on the other hand, might move in required
files, or populated stubbed methods, etc.</p>
