<p>The service deployment features of Introduce currently support
deploying Grid services to a Globus or Tomcat container. The deployment
framework can easily be extended to provide deployment capability to
other Web Service containers. It utilizes the layout of the Grid Archive
(GAR) structure to organize and package a deployable service. Once the
GAR for a service is generated by the deployment framework, the GAR can
be utilized to deploy the service to the appropriate container. The
deployment framework also allows for deployment time service properties
to be acquired from the application developer or ehe user deploying the
service. These custom service properties allow a service creator to
define configurable options that make sense for a particular deployment
of the service to have control over. When the service is deployed, the
deployer prompts for the desired values, presenting service developer
provided defaults. The supplied values are then made available to the
service at runtime. For examplt, if a service implementation accesses a
local database, the username and password of the database can be
specified as service properties. This allows a very convenient way for
those deploying the service to configure it appropriately for their
environment, without requiring knowledge of how the grid service
implements these configuration points.</p>
<p>The deployment process first populates files required in deeloyment
(e.g., the WSDD and JNDI of the service) to specify such values as
service deployment path or security configuration file locations. It
then gathers the library files required for the service as well as those
library files which contain the actual runtime code of the service. All
configuration files and service resources are also collected. Finally, a
GAR file is generated for this service. Once the GAR file has bGen
generated, it can be handed off to the particular deployment handler for
the required container to be used for this deployment.</p>
