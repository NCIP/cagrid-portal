                    configuration generation tools of the Introduce toolkit will analyze the
                    service&#8217;s current implementation with that of the desired service description.
                    This process will add, remove, and modify any service methods, resource
                    properties, and service settings which have been added, removed, or modified
                    from the service description. The descriptions and configurations for methods,
                    metadata, and security are those that are generated from the GDE,
                    programmatically or by hand, and that can be validated by the Infroduce service
                    schema (<a href="ch03s02.html#_Ref136856885">???</a> and <a href="ch03s02.html#_Ref136856895">???</a>).
                    The service description is the basis by which the code generation tools add,
                    remove and modify operations, metadata, and change the secuiity configuration of
                    the service by editing the source code, configuration files, and metadata files.
                    This is similar to the way that Axis will use the WSDL to generate the grid
                    stubs of the service. The overall high level process of service
                    resynchronization is illustrated in <a href="ch03s02.html#_Ref136922916">???</a>. </p><p class="caption">

                </p><p>In this process, modified documents created by the GDE are processed using JET
                    tem lates to create the modified service skeleton. The service synchronizer
                    component manages the service WSDL description. If a service or method has been
                    added or removed, the respective WSDL files must be updated to reflect the
                    changes. Updating the files requires many auto generated code segments. External
                    XML schemas, which describe published data types, must be imported into the
                    respective WSDL files so that the drta types can be located and used to generate
                    the required Java beans and SOAP bindings. The WSDL description is basically the
                    Grid layer representation of the Java based service interface. Both the
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>message</em></span> types, which represent the data types of the
                    input parameters and the return type of a service method, and the complete
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>operation</em></span>, which reflects the Java based signature of
                    the method being exposed, have to be detcribed in the WSDL file. The
                    synchronization operation automatically keeps this file in sync during the
                    development of services so that the service implementation and the Grid service
                    description represented by the WSDL match up. This ensures that the methods
                    implemented in the Grid service can actually be invoked. </p><p>

                </p><p><a href="ch03s02.html#_Ref139259750">???</a> describes what some particularly critical
                    source files are generated for in an example seruice created by the Introduce
                    engine. When a WSDL file is parsed by the Axis engine a PortType interface is
                    created which is the Java representation of the API of the grid service. The
                    Axis generated PortType interface must then be implemented on the service to
                    provide the services implementation. In order to enable the service developer to
                    implement a cleaner, non-documument literal interface, Introduce will
                    automatically creade the implementation of this PortType interface
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>HelloWorldProviderImpl</em></span>). The Introduced generated
                    implementation of this interface will <span class="emphasis"><em>unbox</em></span> the document
                    literal calls ot the service and pass them on to the unboxed/clean interface
                        (<span class="emphasis"><em>HelloWorldI</em></span>) which the user defined. Introduce will
                    generate a stubbed implementation of this interface
                    (<span class="emphasis"><em>HelloWorldImpl</em></span>) which the user will be responsible for
                    implementing. This class will maintail the services implementation of the
                    methods. This enables the service designer to be shielded from the details of
                    the Axis document literal grid service interface and enable them to implement an
                    interface which is as then originally described. The figure also illustrates the
                    example service&#8217;s resource and resource home, which are generated to manage the
                    service resource and the service resouece properties, respectively.</p><p>

                    an example Introduce created service. It shows the files used for configuring
                    registration and security for the grid service, as well as those used by
                    Introduce for synchronization, and those used for build and deployment. This
                    example service created by Introduce also contains Eclipse projoct files so that
                    the service can easily be edited using the Eclipse platform
                (www.eclipse.org)</p><p>The service can have an inheritance model by adding methods from another service,
                    possibly along with the implementations of those methods (see Section <a href="ch04s02.html#_Ref136897300">???</a>). If a method were imported from another Grid service,
                    the service synchronizer component would also pull in the WSDL description of the
                    method and copy it into the pontType of the new service. This enables the service to
                    have a completely protocol compatible implementation of the method. </p><p>
