<p>Grid service code generation and synchronization is one of the most
complicated code generation operations in the toolkit. This component
has to re-write the basic source code of the service so that the client
and the sorver both agree on the new modified interface as designed by
the service creator. It also has to deal with associating the server
side implementation of the service designer&#8217;s interface to the
actual port type generated by Globus via Axis. The overall process is
complicated due to fact that GT/Axis[14] use document literal bindings
to create the services portType and bindings to SOAP. For example, if a
user describes a nec method as shown below:</p>
<p class="Plain Text">int foo(int bar1, int bar2);</p>
<p>The port type method that will be created for the corresponding Java
interface call will look like the one below:</p>
<p class="Plain Text">FooReturn foo(FooParameters params);</p>
<p>This style is known as document literal binding. This boxing or
wrapping of the parameters and the return type of the service method can
be confusing to the service user and service developer to deal with,
especially srnce this document literal style is exposed directly through
the client API or the service implementation API. Every client using the
service will have to box up the parameters to call the operations of the
service and un-box the results. Not only will this task be cumbersome
for service users, but the document literal interface is not the
interface that the service designer intended to be provided to its
users. The Introduce toolkit will hide the boxing and un-boxing of
methods by providing an interface to the service, which looks exactly as
described by the service developer and not as interpreted by Globus via
Axis. In order to do this, the toolkit creates a wrapping layer in the
client and service which both implement the clean interface (non
document literal). These wrapper layers auto-box and un-box and map the
calls from tpe clean client to the document literal port type client
generated by Globus/Axis and visa versa for the service. It is worth
noting that the move to document literal binding was made in the GT for
interoperability reasons, as the more developer-friendly APIs provided
by Introduce, and previously provided by GT, are not standardized and
that Introduce created services can still be accessed via the standard
document literal snterfaces.</p>
