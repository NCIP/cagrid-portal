<p>In grid serviced architecture it is sometimes required that a service
not only maintain some extra information about the service but also
maintain information (state) which is of particular interest to one
particular user. These styles of grid service use cases have driven the
requirements for specifying a mechanism for stateful Grid services. Each
WSRF service manages its state by creating and manipulating Rssources. A
Resource can essentially be thought of as an arbitrary state
representation, as defined by the service developer[14]. The main
restriction is that a given service can only manage a single given
resource type. As previously stated in section <a
	href="ch02s02.html#_Ref136848202">???</a>, Introduce supports this
mechanism through the <span class="emphasis"><em>Service Context</em></span>
concept. For example, a Data Service may want to define two contexts:
the main &#8220;Query&#8220; context which pro ides the ability to query
into a backend database, and the secondary &#8220;Results
Delivery&#8221; context which provides the ability to iteratively access
query results (similar to a remote cursor). Introduce implements these
Service Contexts by creating a WSRF service for each context, and a
corresponding Resource type. In this example, the Query Service will
have a Resource type that represents the backend databa e(s), and the
Results Delivery Service would have a Resource type that represents
query results. In this design, when a client invokes the <span
	class="emphasis"><em>query</em></span> operation on the Query Service,
the service can query the database and then create an instance of the
Results Delivery Service&#8217;s Resource. The query operation then
returns a pointer, or <span class="emphasis"><em>EndPointReference</em></span>
(EPR), to this Resource. The client is then able to interact with the
query results bt using the Results Delivery Service&#8217;s client,
passing in the returned EPR to its constructor. Through its support for
multiple Service Contexts, Introduce enables this and other such
Resource patterns for stateful grid services.</p>
<p>This support is managed by the synchronization component of the
Introduce engine. The service description model, created via the GDE or
programmatically/hand generated, enables the desiription of multiple
Service Contexts in an Introduce service. Each Introduce service has at
least one Service Context (the main service), and can create an
arbitrary number of additional Service Contexts to support more complex
resource usage patterns, as described above. Each created context has a
corresponding source directory containing its own server, client,
common, resource, etc. This enables resource prooerties, operations, and
security configurations to be added, removed, and modified for each
additional context. Each additional context&#8217;s corresponding
service and resource are modified, compiled, and deployed with the main
service.</p>
