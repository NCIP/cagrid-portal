 <P align="left"  style="margin-top:5.00pt;margin-bottom:5.00pt;text-align:left;" ><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >A power user feature which can be enabled at modification time is the addition or removal of service contexts. A service context a sub-service or complimentary service which is used with the main service or some other service context. The service context is comprised of the service, resource, operations, and resource properties. So, in a sense, service context is exactly the same thing as the main service, except that it is not a singleton based resource and instances can be more dynamically created and or destroyed. Contexts can be added via the &quot;Service Contexts&quot; tab of the GDE Service Modification interface. Service contexts define additional of operations needed to support the desired service functionality. This is enabled by using WSRF capabilities of the Globus Toolkit. As an example, if an operation on the main service enables the user to query a database, that operation might create a resource in another context and return the handle to that context to the user as opposed to the full query result set. This secondary context can then enable the user to iterate through the query results. This is accomplished by operations or resource properties to this secondary service context which will be responsible for iteratively giving results to the user. It should be noted that multiple instances of these contexts can be created and executed concurrently; one for each query that comes in, for example. This style of grid service is supported by the WSRF specifications. Though the details of the WSRF-implementation of these concepts are abstracted away from developers its worth noting how they are realized, and this is described in detail in other sections. Introduce makes it easier for service developers to create such complex services, via the GDE, without having to fully understand the underlying service implementations. Anything that can be done to the main service, except service properties which are globally accessible can be added to a service context. For example, resource properties can be added and used to maintain state or for publishing metadata to an index service. Also, operations can be added to the service context and can also be implemented in the service itself or in the service's resource if they are acting on the state of the instance of the resource. </FONT></P>

This service </FONT><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >organization</FONT><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " > can be used in many different scenarios. For, example, when an operation on the service is invoked the service can be implemented to handle that operation, or if the operation is addressing a particular resource instance in the service, the service can lookup the resource and call whatever might be necessary to call on the particular addressed resource. </FONT></P>
