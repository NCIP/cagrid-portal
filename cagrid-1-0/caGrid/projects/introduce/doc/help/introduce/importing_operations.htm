 <P align="left"  style="margin-top:5.00pt;margin-bottom:5.00pt;text-align:left;" ><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >Operations can also be imported from other services. Importing an operation enables the service to implement the exact same operation signature. This enables the service to have an operation which has the exact same WSDL signature of the operation which is being imported. This would enable either client to invoke this operation on either service. Importing can be done in two ways: (1) from an Introduce generated service, or (2) from a WSDL file. For case 1, importing from an Introduce service, the developer would browse and select the Introduce generated service which contains the operation to be imported. Once the Introduce service is selected a list of services which contain this method will be available to select from. Select the service from which you want to import the operation. The methods signature will be imported and the developer will be prompted to make sure to copy over the WSDL and XSD files needed to import the method into the schema&lt;service name&gt; directory of the service. For case 2, if a method is described in another WSDL but the developer wants to implement this exact method from this WSDL. The developer must have the WSDL and corresponding XSD's in the schema/&lt;service name&gt; directory of the service. Then the developer will be able to browse those WSDL files and select the port type they wish to import the operation from. The importing of a method across services will assure not only that each service has completely protocol compatible methods but also that each service's method can be invoked by the same base client. This enables the notion of basic inheritance in grid services and is discussed further in </FONT><A href="importing_operations.htm"><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >Operation Importing</FONT></A><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " > </FONT><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >. </FONT></P>
