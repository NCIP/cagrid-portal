 <P align="left"  style="margin-top:5.00pt;margin-bottom:5.00pt;text-align:left;" ><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >Introduce provides support for exposing service state and metadata by abstracting away the details of common patterns of use of the WSRF. The WSRF specifications and the GT implementation of these specifications allow the creation of stateful Grid services, whilst remaining compatible with existing Web Service standards. A Grid service's state (and metadata) is maintained in the Resource represented by the service, as described in the WSRF specification, and is exposed to clients by way of Resource Properties. Introduce allows its users to expose state or metadata of their services by managing the definition, creation, and population of the Resource Properties of a service instance. Upon creating a service, a service developer is able to simply select from a list of common resource usage patterns, and Introduce will manage the complete generation of the necessary backend code and configuration to implement that pattern. Once the resource pattern is defined, a service developer can then select data types they wish to use in order to expose state or metadata of its resources by way of Resource Properties. Developers need only select a data type they wish to expose, and Introduce makes it available as a WSRF standard Resource Property. Developers are able to either programmatically control the values of the property at runtime (as is common for exposed resource state), or supply the initial value from a file at service startup (as is common for exposed metadata). Another powerful feature of Resource Properties is that they can be advertised to, and aggregated at, a remote indexing service &#150; an indexing service can be used by clients and other services to discover services in the Grid environment. GT provides such a service in the form of the Index Service. It acts as the white and yellow pages of the grid, providing resource and service discovery. Introduce allows a service developer to maintain soft-state registration of its resource properties by simply selecting a check box on each property they wish to register. For each such property, it creates all of the necessary source code and configuration changes necessary to periodically register the property with an Index Service, and ensure the most recent value of the property is made available in the Index Service and associated with the service. The combination of these two simple-to-use, yet powerful features, allows a service provider to, for instance, automatically provide and register a description of its service to a central repository when the service is running. </FONT></P>
