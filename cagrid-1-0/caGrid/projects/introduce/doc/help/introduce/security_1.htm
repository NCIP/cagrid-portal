Moreover, Security can be enforced on both the client and service sides. Introduce allows service developers to specify the secure communication mechanism(s), in which clients are allowed to communicate with the service. An Introduce generated client can automatically be configured to communicate over the secure communication mechanism specified by the service. In the case where multiple secure communication mechanisms are supported by the service, Introduce will allow the service developer to choose which mechanism the client will use. </FONT></P>

For the most part, Introduce users need not concern themselves with all the details, but should have a basic understanding of what is happening under the hood, and should understand how provide credentials for secure communication with services. </FONT></P>
 <P  style="margin-top:0.00pt;margin-bottom:0.00pt;" ><FONT size=3  style="font-size:12pt; " >Introduce builds on GSI (Globus Security Infrastructure), and hence uses Public Key Cryptography (PKI). Both services and clients may optionally have credentials (certificates), and authenticate and authorize each other. Services and corresponding clients generated from the Introduce toolkit attempt to automatically configure security appropriately, and this behavior is sufficient for most users, however it can be overridden (either by manually configuring this client &quot;stub&quot; or by overriding the provided configureStubSecurity method). Introduce clients will attempt to communicate anonymously with services, as long as the service allows it (as advertised via its ServiceSecurityMetadata). If a service does not allow anonymous communication, client credentials must be used to authenticate with the service. Introduce created clients will attempt to use the default Globus credentials if present (via a grid-proxy-init, or logging in with Dorian and specifying to set the credentials as the defaults). Alternatively, Introduce created clients have constructors which take credentials (GlobusCredential), and also have an appropriate setter method (setProxy), which can be used after construction. Some services have different security requirements for different operations, so it may not be immediately obvious whether or not credentials are required. As such, when communicating with secure services it is good practice to have a valid grid proxy set as default, or specified on the client; the client APIs will only use it if necessary. </FONT></P>
