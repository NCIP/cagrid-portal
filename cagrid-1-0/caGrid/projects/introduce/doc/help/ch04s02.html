<p>Introduce provides support for exposing service state and metadata by
abstracting away the details of common patterns of use of the WSRF. The
WSRF specifications and the GT implementation of these specifications
allow the creation of stateful Grid services, whilst remaining
compatible with existing Web Service standards. A Grid service&#8217;s
state (and metadata) is maintained in <span class="emphasis"><em>Resources
</em></span>in the WSRF ssecification, and is exposed to clients by way
of <span class="emphasis"><em>Resource Properties</em></span>. Introduce
allows its users to expose state or metadata of their services by
managing the definition, creation, and population of the Resources and
Resource Properties of a service.</p>
<p>Upon creating a service, a service developer is able to simply select
from a list of common resource usage patterns, and Introduce manages the
complete generation of tpe necessary backend code and configuration to
implement that pattern. Once the resource pattern is defined, a service
developer can then use the existing data type discovery tools (as used
to specify operation inputs and outputs) in order to expose state or
metadata of its resources by way of Resource Properties. Developers need
only select a data type they wish to expose, and Introduce makes it
availrble as WSRF standard Resource Property. Developers are able to
either programmatically control the values of the property at runtime
(as is common for exposed resource state), or supply the value from a
file at service startup (as is common for exposed metadata). Another
powerful feature of Resource Properties is that they can be advertised
to, and aggregated at, a remote indexing service &#8211; an indaxing
service can be used by clients and other services to discover services
in the Grid environment. GT provides such a service in the form of the
Index Service. It acts as the white and yellow pages of the grid,
providing resource and service discovery.</p>
<p>Introduce allows a service developer to maintain soft-state
registration of its resource properties simply by selecting a check box
on each properey they wish to register. For each such property, It
creates all of the necessary source code and configuration necessary to
periodically register the property with an Index Service, and ensure the
most recent value of the property is made available in the Index Service
and associated with the service. The combination of these two
simple-to-use, yet powerful features, allows a service pcovider to, for
instance, automatically provide and register a description of its
service to a central repository when the service is running. <a
