Migration from 1.0B to .9999 mainstream

A new field to the ResourcePropertiesType was added called fileLocation.  This field
is used to tell introduce what file to use for reading in a populateFromFile resource
property.  If you do not metadata files aleady filed out then you should not see a problem.
If you do be sure that you go into this introduce.xml file and set that location to be relative
to the etc directory and pointing to the file which represents that particular resource
property instance document.

For example:

  <ns6:ResourcePropertiesList xsi:type="ns6:ResourcePropertiesListType" xmlns:ns6="gme://gov.nih.nci.cagrid.introduce/1/Resources">
    <ns6:ResourceProperty qName="ns7:ServiceMetadata" fileLocation="HelloWorld_serviceMetadata.xml" populateFromFile="true" register="true" xsi:type="ns6:ResourcePropertyType" xmlns:ns7="gme://caGrid.caBIG/1.0/gov.nih.nci.cagrid.metadata"/>
   </ns6:ResourcePropertiesList>
   
   
Removed synconizedResourceFramework from the ResourcePropertiesType bean.

<resourceLink> have been added for every sub resources home to al other sub resource homes

a baseImpl has been added to the server to hide some of the provided methods from the users implemenation

wsdl files where not importing xsd's correctly so changed the wsdl to define the namespaces of all types in the top of hte wsdl
and import the xsd's in the schema part of the wsdl

jar file names of all introduce jars has been changed to the new caGrid approved style "caGrid-1.0-Introduce-*"

added a way to set your resource type to CUSTOM which tells the engine not to add any resource implementation for you service and tells you in the JNDI what to add.

added support for importing methods from WSDL which use messages that use types and not elements
 
added a schema for the service called "<ServiceName>Types.xsd" which gets a reference (typed EPR) added to it so that others can chose to use it as well
this schema is used by the GUI to define new faults that can be used in your or others services.

The client handle return functionality has been changed to use the strongly typed EPR's from above instead of the regular EPRs
