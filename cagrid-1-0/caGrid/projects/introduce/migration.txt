Migration from 1.0B to .9999 mainstream

A new field to the ResourcePropertiesType was added called fileLocation.  This field
is used to tell introduce what file to use for reading in a populateFromFile resource
property.  If you do not metadata files aleady filed out then you should not see a problem.
If you do be sure that you go into this introduce.xml file and set that location to be relative
to the etc directory and pointing to the file which represents that particular resource
property instance document.

For example:

  <ns6:ResourcePropertiesList xsi:type="ns6:ResourcePropertiesListType" xmlns:ns6="gme://gov.nih.nci.cagrid.introduce/1/Resources">
    <ns6:ResourceProperty qName="ns7:ServiceMetadata" fileLocation="HelloWorld_serviceMetadata.xml" populateFromFile="true" register="true" xsi:type="ns6:ResourcePropertyType" xmlns:ns7="gme://caGrid.caBIG/1.0/gov.nih.nci.cagrid.metadata"/>
   </ns6:ResourcePropertiesList>
