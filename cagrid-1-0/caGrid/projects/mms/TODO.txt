springize imlementation? (load the cadsr implementation)?

define metadata for "source" and "source properties" to expose (could use a "load from file" or ideally ask the springized impl for its metadata on what it supports)
--need a "default" source to be used when client doesn't specify otherwise

use gme pattern to load impl via deploy property


ideally anotateServiceMetadata could take something like UMLProjectIdentifier, but every type could come from a different project/source so 
really need to use the uml2xml binding lookup and have some way to pass namespace=>source mapping information
-probably annotateServiceMetadata(ServiceMetadata, (optional) Map<URI,Source>)
-- when no map is provided, the service's "default" source should be used.



Source Requirements:
-identify "projects" by id and optional version
-create domain models for a given identified project
-map QName of element to its corresponding UMLClass 


Future metadata model probably needs a way to identify the "source" the information came from
