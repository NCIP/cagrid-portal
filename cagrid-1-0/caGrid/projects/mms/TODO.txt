finish caDSR implementation


how to handle the packaging of the application-config-client.xml
--currently bundled in commmon jar... SDK doesnt give a way to put elsewhere, so atleast put it in a different jar
--probably want to refactor the packages for MMS and impls, and put each impl in its own jar (otherwise ppl using alternate impls will have the cadsr stuff in their mms service jar)


caDSR source properties:
publicid
gmeNamespace
longName
id -->shortName
version -->version



Source Requirements:
-identify "projects" by id and optional version
-create domain models for a given identified project
-map QName of element to its corresponding UMLClass 


Future cagrid metadata model probably needs a way to identify the "source" the information came from
