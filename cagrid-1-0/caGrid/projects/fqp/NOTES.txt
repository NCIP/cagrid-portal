CAVEATS:
==============================
DCQL Foriegn Predicate values must be a subset of CQL Predicate values, as the former is used to contruct the later in the engine.


ISSUES:
==============================
change build to create client-usable engine (outside of service)

build service to support synchronous query execution (with status RPs, etc)

should we add query return modifiers to DCQL? (not trivial, as they have to work "in code" against aggregate results... can't be pushed to backend)

need to use thread pool for sending out CQL queries

(DONE) change inner CQL queries to use return modifiers to only return distinct join att values

(FIXED) impl only works with EQUAL_TO as the join condition

(FIXED) need to aggregate results when targeting multiple services... currently only return uses last result
  - probably want to make a new DCQL result that contains a CQL results collection for each target service 

impl doesn't properly handle empty foriegn association results
  - replaces with an IS_NULL predicate
  - needs to make an impossible predicate (att=1  AND att=2)
  
impl doesn't handle foreign associations with only 1 result
  - makes a group with one element (groups require 2 or more)
  - return either single attribute (preferred) or make redundant copy (simple but ugly/inefficient)
  
add unit and system tests    

add DCQL XSD validation?
