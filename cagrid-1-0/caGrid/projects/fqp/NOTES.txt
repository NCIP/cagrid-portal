CAVEATS:
==============================
DCQL Foriegn Predicate values must be a subset of CQL Predicate values, as the former is used to contruct the later in the engine.


ISSUES:
==============================


FUTURE WORK:
==============================
service property to limit max retries, timeouts, target services, etc.  prevent malicious client from overwhelming the service

add properties to main service to track number of active resources?

should we add query return modifiers to DCQL? (not trivial, as they have to work "in code" against aggregate results... can't be pushed to backend)
	-- CQL 2 will support new query modifiers, so DCQL 2 can as well.  CQL 2 currently in tech preview, dcql 2 to follow

add DCQL XSD validation?


IN PROGRESS WORK:
==============================
(75%) add unit and system tests


COMPLETED WORK:
==============================
(DONE) query w/ caGrid transfer of results
	-- server side needs refinement for efficiency

(DONE) query w/ ws-enumeration of results
	-- server side needs refinement for efficiency

(DONE) security with delegation!

(DONE) add topic notification to query completion status

(DONE) change build to create client-usable engine (outside of service)

(DONE) unify FQEngine code that uses processor to reuse better

(DONE) clean up result service code (errors, etc)

(DONE) allow client setting of termination time of result resource (currently configured by the service, and destroyable by the client... no way to renew lease)

(DONE) need resource lifetime on query results

(DONE) build service to support synchronous query execution (with status RPs, etc)

(DONE) should use thread pool for sending out CQL queries?

(FIXED) processing of DCQL Group is broken... if it contains both nested groups and foreign assoications, the later will replace the former in the generated query

(FIXED) need to aggregate results when targeting multiple services... currently only return uses last result
  - (DONE) probably want to make a new DCQL result that contains a CQL results collection for each target service 

(DONE) change inner CQL queries to use return modifiers to only return distinct join att values

(FIXED) impl only works with EQUAL_TO as the join condition

(DONE) impl doesn't properly handle empty foriegn association results
  - replaces with an IS_NULL predicate
  - needs to make an impossible predicate (IS_NULL AND IS_NOT_NULL)
  
(DONE - second approach for now) impl doesn't handle foreign associations with only 1 result
  - makes a group with one element (groups require 2 or more)
  - return either single attribute (preferred) or make redundant copy (simple but ugly/inefficient)
