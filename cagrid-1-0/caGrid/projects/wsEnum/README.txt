WS-Enum project for caGrid 1.0

This project houses the WS-Enumeration schema, wsdl, and modified Globus WsCore jar for implementing WS-Enumeration.

The wsrf_core jar was created from modified source, using the patch available at http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Java_WS_Core_WS_Enumeration

Any wrappers, tests, demos, and custom clients for WS-Enumeration belong in here.
