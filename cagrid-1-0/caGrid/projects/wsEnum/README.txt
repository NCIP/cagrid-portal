WS-Enum project for caGrid 1.0

This project houses the WS-Enumeration schema, wsdl, and modified Globus WsCore jar for implementing WS-Enumeration.

The wsrf_core jar was created from modified source, using the patch available at http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~gawor/ws-enum/

Any wrappers, tests, demos, and custom clients for WS-Enumeration belong in here.
