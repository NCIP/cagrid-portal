Provided libraries:
lib/wsrf_core_enum.jar -- Implementation of WS-Enumeration provided by Globus Ws Core 4.0.2 after patch has been applied.
lib/wsrf_core_stubs_enum.jar -- Stubs needed for WS-Enumeration provided by Globus Ws Core 4.0.2 after patch has been applied.
build/lib/caGrid-1.0-wsEnum.jar -- Utilities and constants for WS-Enumeration project

Tasks:
1 [D]: Utilities to simplify creating an enumeration resource context and response from a List of objects.
2 [D]: Simple EnumIterator implementaion which can create / read an indexed file for persisting caCORE sdk and Globus generated objects.
	-- This implementation will respect the maxElements iteration constraint, but not necessairly maxCharacters or maxTime.
3 [I]: More complicated EnumIterator implementaion which can create / read an indexed file for presisting caCORE sdk and Globus generated objects.
	-- This implementation will respect all of the IterationConstraints supplied.
4 [ ]: On Deploy of a WS-Enumeration service, the wsrf_core (and wsrf_core_stubs???) jars must be removed / overwritten with the wsrf_core[_stubs]_enum jars.
5 [ ]: [Simple]PersistantSDKObjectIterator needs to have a unique wsdd config for each instance.

Points:
	-- The [Simple]PersistantSDKObjectIterator classes write the list of objects given as serialized XML on the file system.  By default, the XML is written to <user's home dir>/.cagrid/SDKEnumIterator/.  For security reasons, access to this directory should be strictly controlled.  If the serialization file is specified, please take security of the file system into concideration.
