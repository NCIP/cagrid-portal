XML Representations of Schemas

A schema is represented in XML by one or more schema document, 
that is, one or more [schema] element information items. 

A schema document contains representations for a collection of schema components, 
e.g. type definitions and element declarations, which have a common [target namespace]. 

A schema document which has one or more [import] element information items corresponds to 
a schema with components with more than one [target namespace], see [Import Constraints and Semantics].



















AMR00

includes processed within a namespace (can't upload a schema with out its includes)

schema upload/download needs to be done as a tree structure
  -imports done against the system id of the root of the tree

AMR01
last modified for each schema
be able to ask for it (so client can determine if they have newest version when working with dev versions)
need aggregate modified calcuated from schema and all of its namespaces



AMR02
schemas are processed by all schemas in namespace

if existing schema includes are in database, if namespace is updated, all includes need to be resolved against
schema in submission set; can't mix and match with includes in database and includes in submission set
