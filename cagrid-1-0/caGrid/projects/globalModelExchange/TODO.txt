NEED TO IVYIZE spring-mock.jar

edit service to load properties and spring config (similar to cds)

fix test to load properties correctly (remove property placeholder in config)

need to deal with db creation for testing

finish hibernate annotations

springize GME:
  -schemapersistence
  -GMEXMLSchemaLoader
  -policy?
  -something to get current identity (UserInformationProvider.getCurrentUserIdentity()?)


    

add a test for no namespace schema (need to disallow)

add a test for schema with unused schemadocument (need to disallow)

add a test for redefine

add tests for multi-level include/import processing (e.g A includes B include C imports D includes E)

add tests which check our use of ns as the basesystemid (i.e., does new URI(ns,systemID)
  always work as the documentLocation?... our include checking requires it to currently)
  --for example, im pretty sure absolute path file includes will fail, but I think we want those to fail anyway (might just want a better message)
  --probably just need to make a constraint that includes/systemIDs need to be relative URIs 

add a test which does import of no namespace schema (need to disallow)

need to check use of these we need:

should be able to add a validateXMLDocument method that uses the schemaloader
 to resolve the documents schema, and then validate it
