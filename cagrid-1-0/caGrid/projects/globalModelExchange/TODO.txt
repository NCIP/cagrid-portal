TESTS TO WRITE:
==========
add deploy system test
  add unsuccessful deploy system test that uses wrong database information and make sure service wont start

add a test for "already defined"

add a test for schema with unused schemadocument (need to disallow)

add tests for multi-level include/import processing (e.g A includes B include C imports D includes E)

add tests which check our use of ns as the basesystemid (i.e., does new URI(ns,systemID)
  always work as the documentLocation?... our include checking requires it to currently)
  --for example, im pretty sure absolute path file includes will fail, but I think we want those to fail anyway (might just want a better message)
  --probably just need to make a constraint that includes/systemIDs need to be relative URIs 

add a test which does import of no namespace schema (need to disallow)



springize GME:
  -[done] schemapersistence
  -GMEXMLSchemaLoader
    - look into using this: http://static.springframework.org/spring/docs/2.0.x/api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/ServiceLocatorFactoryBean.html
  -policy?
  -something to get current identity (UserInformationProvider.getCurrentUserIdentity()?)
    

need to check use of these we need:
http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/features.html


should be able to add a validateXMLDocument method that uses the schemaloader
 to resolve the documents schema, and then validate it
