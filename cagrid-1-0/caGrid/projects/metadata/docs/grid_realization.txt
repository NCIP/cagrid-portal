There will be one ResourceProperty exposed for ALL services: caGridMetadata (or something similarly named)

The "Service" element is the main entrypoint, which other metadata hangs off of.
Core services (which aren't necessarily Gold compatible, as they don't expose operations 
over caDSR-registered data types) will just not have any Operations defined.  The Operations
will just represent the offical caBIG operations on the service.  All caBIG services will have
some operations that aren't modeled in this metadata (such as ResourceProperty related operations), for core
services, all operations may fall under that category.

Service will have optional Associations to other runtime, and service-specific metadata, such as
  Data Service metadata, and research center information (previously exposed as common service metadata).
This will allow us extensibility to also hang other types of metadata off of the service (such as LexBIG metadata, etc), 
and allow DiscoveryClient extensions to make use of this feature for service-specific discovery (such as LexBIG).
This will be an xsd:any in the XSD.

Does this have ramifications on deserialization of metadata through the generic metadata utils client?
If so, we could just make sure there are proper finer grain accessors as opposed to just returning the top element.
For example, getServiceContexts(), getResearchCenterInfo(), etc 


   
TODO:
====================
How to add "runtime" attributes?
 -add only to types in the XSD and not in model?
 -make runtime sub-type static? 


XSD/Bean Generation
====================
1) Model metadata in Enterprise Architect
2) Export Logical Model Package to XMI 1.0
3) Open as XMI in hyperModel(http://update.xmlmodeling.com/updates/index.html)
4) For each package:
  4.1) Right-click, Open With-> XML Schema
  4.2) Save as *.xsd
5) Fix all XSDs by adding proper targetnamespaces, and xsd:imports; convert java primatives to xsd primatives
6) Use XSDs as types in Globus build (generate beans from XSD)
