XSD/Bean Generation
====================
UML to XSD:

http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2001/09/19/uml.html

In EA:

To Use Enterprise Architect (preferred)
-----------------------------
1) Model metadata in Enterprise Architect
2) For each package:
  2.1) Set tagged values:
	memberNames = unqualified
	elementFormDefault = qualified
	anonymousType = false    -- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEFAULT (but appears to be a bug in some versions of EA [at least 6.1])
	targetNamespace = <according to caGrid rules>
	targetNamespacePrefix = <something short and unique in the project>
  2.2) Right-click, Code Engineering ... Generate XML Schema
  2.3) Save as appropriate *.xsd
3) Fix all XSDs by cleaning up xsd:imports
4) Use XSDs as types in Globus build (generate beans from XSD)


To Use hyperModel
-----------------------------
1) Model metadata in Enterprise Architect
2) Export Logical Model Package to XMI 1.0
3) Open as XMI in hyperModel(http://update.xmlmodeling.com/updates/index.html)
4) For each package:
  4.1) Right-click, Open With-> XML Schema
  4.2) Save as *.xsd
5) Fix all XSDs by adding proper targetnamespaces, and xsd:imports; convert java primatives to xsd primatives
6) Use XSDs as types in Globus build (generate beans from XSD)



BUGS:
-----------------------------
(fixed in 4.0.3?) The perfectly legal snippet below from the common.xsd generated XSD needs to be replaced with 
the (functionaly equivalent) snippet below it, as there is a bug in Axis with the Beans it generates this type.

----- REPLACE -----
<xs:sequence>
    <xs:element ref="uml:SemanticMetadata" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" />
</xs:sequence>
----- END REPLACE -----

----- WITH -----
<xs:choice minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded">
	<xs:element ref="uml:SemanticMetadata" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
</xs:choice>
