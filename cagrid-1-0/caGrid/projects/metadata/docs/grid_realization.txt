There will be one ResourceProperty exposed for ALL services: caGridMetadata (or something similarly named)

The "Service" element is the main entrypoint, which other metadata hangs off of.
Core services (which aren't necessarily Gold compatible, as they don't expose operations 
over caDSR-registered data types) will just not have any Operations defined.  The Operations
will just represent the offical caBIG operations on the service.  All caBIG services will have
some operations that aren't modeled in this metadata (such as ResourceProperty related operations), for core
services, all operations may fall under that category.  This is a generalization of previous  (0.5) analytical
metadata.  Now all services will have ServiceMetadata (0.5 equivalent to commom and analytical metadata).
Specific common service types, such as data or vocabulary serivices, will have additional metadata types
and those will be exposed as separate Resource Properties.


XSD/Bean Generation
====================
1) Model metadata in Enterprise Architect
2) Export Logical Model Package to XMI 1.0
3) Open as XMI in hyperModel(http://update.xmlmodeling.com/updates/index.html)
4) For each package:
  4.1) Right-click, Open With-> XML Schema
  4.2) Save as *.xsd
5) Fix all XSDs by adding proper targetnamespaces, and xsd:imports; convert java primatives to xsd primatives
6) Use XSDs as types in Globus build (generate beans from XSD)
