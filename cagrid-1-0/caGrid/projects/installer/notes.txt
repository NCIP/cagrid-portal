The first step of the installer should present a list of checkbox controls.
Each control represents a path to execute.
The list of paths can be configured by Spring.

# System Check Installer #
Installs
 - Ant, Globus, Tomcat, and may be mysql
Steps
 - Check if HOME/.cagridenv.properties exists
    - if so, then the installer has been run, so load the properties
      - ant.home
      - globus.home
      - tomcat.home
    - if not, then try to pull these values from system properties
      - ant.home = ANT_HOME
      - globus.home = GLOBUS_HOME
      - tomcat.home = CATALINA_HOME
 - If any component is already installed
   - need to check if it is the appropriate version
     - if it is not the appropriate version it will need to be reinstalled
       - ask the user if the existing installation should be replaced or if it
         should be installed to a new directory
   - even if it is the right version
     - give user the option to use the existing install or install to new location
