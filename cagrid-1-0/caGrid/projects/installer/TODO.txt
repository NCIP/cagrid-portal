Ideas for 2.0 release:
1. general aesthetic enhancements
   - switch to group layout manager
   - use dual progress bar to indicate sub task progress
   - indicate overall progress, using images for each component
2. allow user to set up target grid dynamically
3. enable non-interactive mode
    - requires factoring out some logic in steps that modify files directly
    - two modes:
      - fresh install: new certs and databases
      - re-deploy: use existing certs and databases
4. enable Java WebStart deployment
5. implement dependency model to allow looser coupling of installer to components
6. implement auto-extracting jar to eliminate unzip step
