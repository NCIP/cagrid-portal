caCORE BUGS:

caCORE provided XSD's have the wrong namespace (caCORE.cabig instead of caCORE.caBIG), I've corrected them locally... need to rectify

returning too many classes when there are package aliases

returning same class for association source and target

unable to populate associations as client calls back to ApplServ even if associations are set

attribute name has classname: prefix
