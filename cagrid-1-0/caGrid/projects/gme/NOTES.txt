Need to make sure to prompt for the deployment URL to write in the gme service conf file

when extracting schemas that have different domains but hte same version and name the gme will rewrite over them when doing a 
client side schema cache.

Need to add the metadata required.

need to have deployer configuration 

cache schema needs to use the entire namespace to determine filename, it currently is overwriting files it shouldn't.

gme upload need to verify "import namespace=.." namespaces are all valid, and reject if not (it should ignore schemaLocation)
  gme download, needs to add "import namespace=.." namespaces to the schema node tree as well
