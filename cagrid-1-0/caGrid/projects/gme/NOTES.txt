Need to add the metadata required.

Need to add support for external schemas.

The configureation 

cache schema needs to use the entire namespace to determine filename, it currently is overwriting files it shouldn't.

gme upload need to verify "import namespace=.." namespaces are all valid, and reject if not (it should ignore schemaLocation)
  gme download, needs to add "import namespace=.." namespaces to the schema node tree as well
