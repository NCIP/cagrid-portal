TODO:
-need to clean up the installIntroduceExtension so that it is only copying the absolute
  smallest set of required jars into the introduce extension.

MODS TO THE INTRODUCE GENERATED:
-took the ant all out of the build.xml and moved to the dev-build so that
  i could incoporate the build of the extension
-In the dev-build added a target for installIntroduceExtensions so that the main build
 can copy the required files for the extension to introduce
