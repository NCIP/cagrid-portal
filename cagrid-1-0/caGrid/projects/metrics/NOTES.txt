TODO:
- need to clean up the installIntroduceExtension so that it is only copying the absolute
   smallest set of required jars into the introduce extension.
- client needs to be able to route events to more than one metrics service.

MODS TO THE INTRODUCE GENERATED:
- took the ant all out of the build.xml and moved to the dev-build so that
   i could incorporate the build of the extension
- In the dev-build added a target for installIntroduceExtensions so that the main build
   can copy the required files for the extension to introduce
