Testing Tasks
--------------
(DONE) 1) moving testing resources (e.g. resources/ca-test) to test/resources (e.g. resources/ca-test)
(DONE) 2) Add test/resources to testing classpath
(DONE) 3) Change to loading resources using classloader instead of filesystem
e.g.
	FROM: 
	=====
	public static String DB_CONFIG = "resources" + File.separator + "general-test" + File.separator + "db-config.xml";
    ...
    Document doc = XMLUtilities.fileNameToDocument(DB_CONFIG);
    TO:
    =====
    public static String DB_CONFIG = "/general-test/db-config.xml";
    Document doc = XMLUtilities.streamToDocument(getClass().getResourceAsStream(DB_CONFIG));
(DONE) 4) Don't put these full paths as constants in every file, make some TestConstants.java somewhere that has the paths
(DONE) 5) Don't check in your config files (e.g db-config.xml), you should only check in examples (e.g. db-config.xml.example) and Ant should create the real one from the example


Implementation Issues
----------------------

1) Once user management system is in place, edit the Application Manager registerUser method
such that it checks for already existing users.


Security Test For Globus 4
---------------------------
1) Container Transport Security On (PASSED WITH PROBLEM)
    PROBLEM -> Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Containers
     Caller Identity Received By Service: /O=Ohio State University/OU=BMI/OU=MSCL/CN=Stephen Langella

2) Container Transport Security On, Anonymous (PASSED WITH PROBLEM)
    PROBLEM -> Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Containers
    Caller Identity Received By Service: <anonymous>

3) Container Secure Conversation On (NOT SUPPORTED)

4) Container Secure Conversation On, Anonymous (NOT SUPPORTED)

5) No Container Security, GSI Transport (FAILED)
	PROBLEM -> GSI Transport (encryption only) authentication required for &quot;{http://cagrid.nci.nih.gov/janus}createProxy

6) Container Transport Security On, GSI Transport (PASSED WITH PROBLEM)
    PROBLEM -> Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Containers
     Caller Identity Received By Service: /O=Ohio State University/OU=BMI/OU=MSCL/CN=Stephen Langella

7) Container Transport Security On, GSI Transport, Anonymous (PASSED WITH PROBLEM)
	PROBLEM -> Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Containers
	Caller Identity Received By Service: <anonymous>
	
8) No Container Security, Secure Conversation (PASSED)
	Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Services
	Caller Identity Received By Service: /O=Ohio State University/OU=BMI/OU=MSCL/CN=Stephen Langella

9) No Container Security, Secure Conversation, Anonymous (PASSED)
	Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Services
	Caller Identity Received By Service: null
   
10) Container Transport Security On, Secure Conversation (PASSED WITH PROBLEM)
    PROBLEM -> Credentials Presented to the Client -> The Containers
    Caller Identity Received By Service: /O=Ohio State University/OU=BMI/OU=MSCL/CN=Stephen Langella

11) Container Transport Security On, Secure Conversation, Anonymous (FAILED)
	PROBLEM -> Client dies looking for the proxy, this seems to be a bug since the client should not
	need a proxy.  When i create a proxy and try an anonymous connection is does work correctly.
	Caller Identity Received By Service: <anonymous>

12) Test Security with Proxy Util
