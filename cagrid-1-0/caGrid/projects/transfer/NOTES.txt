Development Thoughts and Modifications
-You have to make a JNDI resource link in the service that is going to use Transfer so that it cant find the TransferContextResourceHome
-Added overwrite=true to the build-deploy.xml
-Took the ant all and clean calls out of the build.xml and modified them and put them in the dev-build.xml

To Do:
- use new version of transfer wsdl
- use a status var instead of staged
- need to add deploy JBoss.....
- need to add method in service helper that takes the ref and returns the resource so that the creator can set term time, destroy,  etc.
