Introduce creates the domain model specific type mappings in the common jar... the "generic" data service client can't be bound to a specific model.
when we deploy a release (with a generic ds client), we can delete that file (it will fall back to globus behavior).

we may want to provide tools to merge wsdd files for data clients (wrap axis admin client).
