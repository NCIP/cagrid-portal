TODO:
1 [D]: On create, data services need to have the data jars placed in their lib directory.
2 [D]: On create, data services need the castor jars in their lib directory
3 [D]: Automagical [client|server]-config.wsdd type mappings
4 [I]: CQL implemetation that works against caCORE generated data sources (sdkQuery project)
5 [D]: Need a way to make sure only the full caGrid-1.0-data.jar gets deployed with data services.  Deploying the more granular jars (service, stubs, etc) causes invocation target errors because classes overlap.
6 [D]: Drop-in user's chosen implementation of CQL Query processing in service query method
	-- Choose query processor jar and it's dependencies at modification
	-- If on build a NoClassDef error is encountered, be sure to add the appropriate jars and or classes to the build classpath, and try building again
7 [I]: Build metadata for data service on codegen
8    : extension.xml needs a property for CADSR_URL
9    : Type Serialization table needs a column to show/edit classname for type (must NOT be set when using DefaultSerialization, MUST be set when using custom or SDK serialization)
