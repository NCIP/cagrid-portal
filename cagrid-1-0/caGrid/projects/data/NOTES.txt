TODO:
1 [D]: On create, data services need to have the data jars placed in their lib directory.
2 [D]: On create, data services need the castor jars in their lib directory
3 [D]: Automagical [client|server]-config.wsdd type mappings
4 [I]: CQL implemetation that works against caCORE generated data sources (sdkQuery project)
5 [D]: Need a way to make sure only the full caGrid-1.0-data.jar gets deployed with data services.  Deploying the more granular jars (service, stubs, etc) causes invocation target errors because classes overlap.
6 [D]: Drop-in user's chosen implementation of CQL Query processing in service query method
	-- Choose query processor jar and it's dependencies at modification
	-- If on build a NoClassDef error is encountered, be sure to add the appropriate jars and or classes to the build classpath, and try building again
7 [D]: Build metadata for data service on codegen
8 [D]: extension.xml needs a property for CADSR_URL
9 [D]: Type Serialization table needs a column to show/edit classname for type (must NOT be set when using DefaultSerialization, MUST be set when using custom or SDK serialization)
10[D]: Adding metadata needs to add the metadata jars and their dependencies (caCORE, etc) 
11[D]: Using add jar should do the "copy" right away in the GUI and the extension data should store the local path
12[D]: .classpath should add in jars that "add jar" copy in, as well those it copies in on creation (metadata stuff, etc)
  [D]:  -- should have mutiple select enabled so you can select multiple jars
13[I]: Need a simplified "SDK Backed" data service option (should set serializers, cql processor, add jars, etc automatically)
	-- Prompt for client.jar from the SDK data source, extract and rename the castor xml mapping file appropriatly.
14[D]: Type serialization table need to enable multi-select for setting serialization option
15[D]: Data GUI needs a way to select a whole project, multiple packages, and classes from them
16[I]: Query Results Iterator / WS-Enumeration support (wsEnum project)
17[ ]: Identifier Resolution Support (Possibly through an operation provider)
18[D]: Pull GME url from introduce properties
19[D]: Block caDSR refresh on modification viewer open should only happen when a data model has already been selected. (e.g. when creating a new data service, the call to cadsr should be threaded and not prevent the modification viewer from opening) 
20[D]: Addition to CQL of queries to return attributes and addition to CQLResult to handle them
21[I]: Change associations in domain model creation to be EXCLUDED associations
22[D]: Feature / usability request: On service sync, if NO CQL Query Processor impl is specified, create a stub impl in the service's dir.
23[D]: Remove package button on DS extension GUI
24[D]: Add Project (all packages in said project) button on DS extension GUI
25[ ]: Don't assume in codegen pre processor that user has configured their CQL Query Processor impl, and the element for this data exists in the extension data.
	-- Could probably be checked in the GUI
26[I]:Some comments on the base CQLQueryProcessor:
    * processQuery should be the only abstract method; in this base class you should default initialize to do nothing and getRequiredParameters to return an empty map.
    * Are the javadocs still accurate for getRequiredParamters now that you have changed the way the properties are stored? ( e.g. does it still have to start with lower case)
    * Need to describe what, if any, constraints there are on the Map’s key value (is it required to contain String->String?)
    * Need to describe the relationship between the Map returned by getRequiredParameters, and that passed in to initialize

BUGS:

When the GUI removes a type it does not remove its schema from the project.  If the schema has the same type as a newly added one (e.g. a user picked the wrong version of his schema) it will give axis bean generation all kinds of problems.
	-- Not a bug; Namespaces can be removed from the service in the Types panel.  There's no simple way to know if the schema added by the domain model building process is in use elsewhere (metadata, methods, etc).
I added a package and it said that it could not find a schema, so I hit cancel.  No model was added to the models list (correctly).  Next I selected a different package, and it popped up the Package incompatibility dialog.  This should not pop up because there are no models added yet.
	-- Fixed 2006-08-01
Eclipse classpath is incorrect (duplicate entries for cagrid core)
	-- Fixed 2006-06-07
Type Serialization Table sizing is screwed up
	-- Fixed 2006-06-07
Need a "None" option for query processor... theres no way to not select an impl found in a jar
	-- Not a bug, you can edit the query processor class selection manually, including blanking it out
	
CAVEATS:
CQL cannot query for nor return 'attributes' of a type that are complexTypes in XML.
