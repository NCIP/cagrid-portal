caGrid 1.0 SDK 3.1 Query Processor

This project contains code to query a silver level data source generated by caCORE SDK from a gold-level caGrid data service by providing an implementation of CQL.

This project requires Java 1.5 to build due to a dependency on caCORE's client.jar file, which is built with jdk 1.5

Look into:
Possible limitation in Hibernate for querying on attributes of a subclass in an association.
	-- Role names have precidence over class names, which may be a requirement because of the class names of associations
	
caCORE SDK Services using CSM
	-- The application service server side must be configured to use the grid CSM security provider
	
Using case-insensitive queries (eg. all values to lowercase and tell DB to ignore case) can cause tremendous slowdown on queries.
	-- The database may not have an index on the lowercase values, therefore they must be generated on the fly for every entry, which is very slow

BUGS:
CoreQueryProcessor / CQL2DetachedCriteria:
	Associations made inside groups are not processed due to limitations in the Hibernate detached criteria query.
	-- All associations appear to be processed as an 'and' operation.  Until I can verify this behavior, association processing is disabled for BOTH 'and' and 'or' logic on groups.
	-- Multiple associations to the same object cannot be made.
	-- http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=931249
	-- http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-879
	-- Try the HQLCoreQueryProcessor, which uses the CQL2HQL helper to make HQL queries

CQL2HQL doesn't properly handle queries begining on the 'many' end of an association (eg Gene's chromosomeCollection).  Valid HQL is generated, but the query will never return true
	-- Fix In Progress (First cut 2006-10-04)
	-- http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=947247&highlight=multiple+joins sums up the issue with using joins to solve the problem.
		-- More recent versions of Hibernate (even 3.0.4...) have fixed this bug
		
CQL2HQL generates queries for boolean attributes using quotes on the values.
	-- Fixed (2006-11-02)

Running multiple instances of a DataService using the SDK query processor in the same container is impossible due to a bug in the caCORE.  Please see http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2784&group_id=38&atid=279 for more information.

CSM security is affected by a similar bug in the caCORE API to the previous.  Executing multiple queries in parallel will cause the session for each new query caller to be lost, probably assigning incorrect security permissions.  For cases where CSM security is enabled on the SDK query processor, all calls to process queries are currently synchronized around a static mutex.  Performance for multiple simultanious queries will suffer, but bad performance is not as important as wrong security.

Queries involving Date attributes of objects are only queried for year, month, and day.  This should be fine, since the concept of a date is exactly that, although the Java util class is more finely grained.

The Predicate 'LIKE' cannot be used when querying against dates.  What does it mean to be 'like November??'  Such queries will fail with a Query Processing Exception
