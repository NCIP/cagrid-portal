caGrid 1.0 SDK Query Processor

This project contains code to query a silver level data source generated by caCORE SDK from a gold-level caGrid data service by providing an implementation of CQL.

This project requires Java 1.5 to build due to a dependency on caCORE's client.jar file, which is built with jdk 1.5

Look into:
Possible limitation in Hibernate for querying on attributes of a subclass in an association.
	-- Role names have precidence over class names, which may be a requirement because of the class names of associations

BUGS:
CoreQueryProcessor / CQL2DetachedCriteria:
	Associations made inside groups are not processed due to limitations in the Hibernate detached criteria query.
	-- All associations appear to be processed as an 'and' operation.  Until I can verify this behavior, association processing is disabled for BOTH 'and' and 'or' logic on groups.
	-- Multiple associations to the same object cannot be made.
	-- http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=931249
	-- http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-879
	-- Try the HQLCoreQueryProcessor, which uses the CQL2HQL helper to make HQL queries
	
Running multiple instances of a DataService using the SDK query processor in the same container is impossible due to a bug in the caCORE.  Please see http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2784&group_id=38&atid=279 for more information.
