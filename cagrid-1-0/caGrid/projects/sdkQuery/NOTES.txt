caGrid 1.0 SDK Query Processor

This project contains code to query a silver level data source generated by caCORE SDK from a gold-level caGrid data service by providing an implementation of CQL.

This project requires Java 1.5 to build due to a dependency on caCORE's client.jar file, which is built with jdk 1.5

Look into:
Possible limitation in Hibernate for querying on attributes of a subclass in an association.
	-- Role names have precidence over class names, which may be a requirement because of the class names of associations

BUGS:
CoreQueryProcessor / CQL2DetachedCriteria:
	Associations made inside groups are not processed due to limitations in the Hibernate detached criteria query.
	-- All associations appear to be processed as an 'and' operation.  Until I can verify this behavior, association processing is disabled for BOTH 'and' and 'or' logic on groups.
	-- Multiple associations to the same object cannot be made.
	-- http://forum.hibernate.org/viewtopic.php?t=931249
	-- http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-879
	-- Try the HQLCoreQueryProcessor, which uses the CQL2HQL helper to make HQL queries

CQL2HQL doesn't properly handle queries begining on the 'many' end of an association (eg Gene's chromosomeCollection).  Valid HQL is generated, but the query will never return true
	-- Fix In Progress
	
Running multiple instances of a DataService using the SDK query processor in the same container is impossible due to a bug in the caCORE.  Please see http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2784&group_id=38&atid=279 for more information.
