caGrid 1.0 SDK Query Processor

This project contains code to query a silver level data source generated by caCORE SDK from a gold-level caGrid data service by providing an implementation of CQL.

This project requires Java 1.5 to build due to a dependency on caCORE's client.jar file, which is built with jdk 1.5
