caGrid 1.0 SDK Query Processor

This project contains code to query a silver level data source generated by caCORE SDK from a gold-level caGrid data service by providing an implementation of CQL.

This project requires Java 1.5 to build due to a dependency on caCORE's client.jar file, which is built with jdk 1.5

BUGS:
Associations made inside groups are not processed due to limitations in the Hibernate detached criteria query.
	-- All associations appear to be processed as an 'and' operation.  Until I can verify this behavior, association processing is disabled for BOTH 'and' and 'or' logic on groups.
	-- Multiple associations to the same object cannot be made.
