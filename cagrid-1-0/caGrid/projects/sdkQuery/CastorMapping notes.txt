Custom castor mappings for SDK data services:

1) copy the castor mapping file to the source root of your service
2) rename the service to prefix it with your service name (eg if your service is "Foo", call it "Foo-xml-mapping.xml")
3) edit the client-config.wsdd to add a global parameter named "castorMapping" with a value of the xml mapping file name
4) edit the server-config.wsdd to add a service parameter named "castorMapping" with a value of the xml mapping file name
