Notes:
=====
- Building against GT 4.0.2 tag

Issues:
=======

1) WS Addressing, namespace is different from specification, for
tooling purposes.
2) Latest specification has a different ns for the schema block in
WSDL, but elements that use that are not qualified with that namespace
(WSDL is invalid).
3) Changed resolve to anyURI rather than anyXML

Questions
==========

- Where should the code live ?
- Package names for the code ?

Resolution Service Prototype
============================

Resolution service provides functionality to resolve an Endpoint
Identifier (EPI) into a corresponding EPR. This implementaion of the
service only supports the "resolve" method in the "Naming" porttype
specified in the ws-naming specification.

The service can be configured to resolve EPI of any service (or
resource). But a given deployment of resolution service can only
resolve EPIs for onex service. The address and the resource key QName
of the service to reolve EPIs for needs to be configured.

The resolution service interacts with the data application to
determine if the said EPI has a mapping. The resolution service allows
for the data application to register an object of the
org.globus.resolution.DataServiceInterface and uses the interface to
verify exisitence of the EPI.

The service requires the client to authenticate when invoking the
resolve method. The distingushed name of the client is also passed as
parameter to the DataServiceInterface.

Implementaion Details
======================

The service code is checked into playground/java/ws-naming.

(A) To deploy the service:
--------------------------

(1) set GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/GT/4.0.2/install
(2) cd playground/java/ws-naming
(3) ant deploy
(4) ant javadocs (to generate java docs)

(B) To configure the service:
------------------------------

(1) Modify
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus_resolution_service/deploy-jndi-config.xml

        (1.1) Set <value> of parameter with name "resolvedKeyQName" to
        the the Qname of the key of the service whose EPR is required.

        (1.2) Set <value> of parameter with name "address" to the URL
        of the service to whose EPR the EPI is being resolved to.

(C) To test the service:
------------------------

(0) Valid credentials are required to test the service
(1) set GLOBUS_LOCATION=/path/to/GT/4.0.2/install
(2) cd playground/java/ws-naming/service/java/test
(3) ant test

(D) To integrate with Data Application
---------------------------------------

(1) Implement the org.globus.resolution.DataServiceInterface.
(2) Create an instance of (1) and register with service. Following API
can be used to do that:
        org.globus.resolution.util.ResolutionUtil.registerDataService()
(3) Note that the Resolution service and the Data Application should
be in same JVM.
