  | deployerConfigContext.xml centralizes into one file some of the declarative configuration that

  | This file declares some of the Spring-managed JavaBeans that make up a CAS deployment.  
  | The beans declared in this file are instantiated at context initialization time by the Spring 
  | ContextLoaderListener declared in web.xml.  It finds this file because this
  | file is among those declared in the context parameter "contextConfigLocation".
