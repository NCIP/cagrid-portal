Things wished for in CQL 2.0 which 1.0 doesn't have:

1) Associated Object Retrieval
2) Temporal queries (Give me all x from 30 days ago)
3) More aggregate queries (min, max)
4) Better data type handling in the query language (eg Dates in attribute values)
5) Complex attribute types

Thoughts on each:

1) MANY people have expressed a need for this in one way or another.  Should be able to ask for "n levels deep", or just a list of named associations to populate.
2) Not sure how this would work.  Use case is for saved queries.  If the data service can understand "thirty days ago", the query can be stored and used without modifying an attribute value each time.
3) These make sense if we can define min and max for non numerical values.  This may only apply to returning distinct attributes, but could extend into queries as well (Give me the sample with the max white blood cell count).  Doing the latter is likley to make the query language quite complex.
4) This would be very nice for the resulting Java beans.  Eliminates confusion about date formats.  Times???
5) This is primarily a modeling problem.  Complex attributes really should be broken down into an association with attributes of its own.  Alternatively, some utilities might be developed which can understand which attributes are "complex" and rewrite the query on the server side into an association + attributes.

Status:

1) Drafted a preliminary AssociationPopulationSpec.xsd
