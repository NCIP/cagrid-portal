<h3>NIH Web Privacy Notice</h3>
<p>
Of the information we learn about you from your visit to "NIH.gov," we store only the 
following: the domain name from which you access the Internet, the date and time you 
access our site, and the Internet address of the web site from which you direct-linked 
to our site. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various 
sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is 
specifically stated otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you.
</p>
<p>
When inquiries are E-mailed to us, we store the question and the E-mail address information 
so that we can respond electronically. Unless otherwise required by statute, we do not identify 
publicly who sends questions or comments to our web site. We will not obtain information that 
will allow us to personally identify you when you visit our site, unless you chose to provide 
such information to us.
</p>
<p>
While visiting sites within the NIH.GOV domain, you may occasionally encounter a Web page that 
employs “cookies”. A cookie is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard 
disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about your session while you are connected.
</p>
<p>
Requests to send cookies from NIH Web pages are not designed to collect information about you, but 
only about your browser "session." The cookie makes it easier for you to use the dynamic features 
of these Web pages. The cookie and the information about your session will be destroyed automatically 
shortly after you close your browser — it is not permanently stored on your computer. Unless an NIH 
web page specifically notifies you otherwise, we will not collect and maintain personal information about you.
</p>
<p>
Many NIH sites are now running customer satisfaction surveys that employ persistent cookies. Participation 
in this data collection effort is completely voluntary, and failure to respond will in no way affect the 
visitor's ability to access information. This information will be used by NIH solely for the purpose of 
improving our public Web sites. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nih.gov/about/asci.htm">More information is available on this use of persistent cookies.</a>
</p>
<p>
To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting 
business with a Web site that uses cookies. If you are concerned about the potential use of information 
gathered from your computer by cookies, you can set your browser to prompt you before it accepts a cookie. 
Most Internet browsers have settings that let you identify and/or reject cookies. Questions about NIH privacy 
policies should be sent to the
